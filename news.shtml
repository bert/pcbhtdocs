    <p>
    Changes included in this release are:
    </p>

    <UL>

<li> Add polygon clipping code.  This is a big change to how polygons are handled.  
  The new code now removes islands and correctly identifies open circuits caused
  by a trace fully cutting through a polygon.  In addition, the RS-274-X output
  is now simpler and works with some board houses that use older non-conforming
  sofware.  Different styles for thermal reliefs are also now supported as part
  of the polygon clipper code.
</li>
<li> Add support for plugins
</li>
<li> Many improvements to the autorouter.
</li>
<li> Various improvements to the trace optimizer.
</li>
<li> Add a fontmode for editing pcb fonts
</li>
<li> Add progress() hook to HID structure
</li>
<li> Fix a bug with non-functional windows on some window managers commonly
  found on OS-X
</li>
<li> Add support for controlling pcb via dbus
</li>
<li> Fix various bugs which would cause a crash
</li>
<li> Add --scale for postscript scaling
</li>
<li> Intercept window manager delete events with the GTK gui
</li>
<li> Scan the .pcb file for a FileVersion value.  This is not written out yet
  but will be in future versions.  
</li>
<li> Warn if non-manhattan lines are trying to become pads.
</li>
<li> Allow no-solder paste pads to support fiducials
</li>
<li> Report in mm or mils as selected by user
</li>
<li> Allow reordering of layers
</li>
<li> add some more QFN packages
</li>
<li> fix building with sun studio c compiler
</li>
<li> Made a pcb installation be relocatable.
</li>
<li> Convert the m4 libraries to newlib libraries as part of building a distfile.
  The m4 libraries are still considered the sources and as such are still
  distributed but this eliminates the need for m4 at runtime for footprints.
</li>
<li> Got rid of the pcb wrapper script around pcb-bin.
</li>
<li> Remove some old footprints of questionable naming, accuracy, or usefulness.
</li>
<li> Get the autosave/backup code working on all GUI's
</li>
<li> Fix some drill size rounding in the reports
</li>
<li> Changed the backup file name to be derived from the .pcb file name
</li>
<li> Added a command line option for DrawGrid
</li>
<li> Fix logic for adding new ratlines
</li>
<li> Fix gtk grid when board is flipped
</li>
<li> Add "find" and "rip-up" buttons to the netlist window
</li>
<li> Draw plated holes when exporting
</li>
<li> Fix some bugs when converting selection to element
</li>
<li> Fix build on cygwin
</li>
<li> Enhance the win32/build_pcb script used to generate a non-cygwin windows
  installer.
</li>
<li> Make pcb work under non-cygwin windows
</li>
</ul>

    </UL>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20060414">Development snapshot 20060414 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    Snapshot release pcb-20060414 has been released.  This is the
    first snapshot of the new HID version of PCB.
    HID, which stands for Human Interface Device is
    the abstraction created by DJ Delorie which
    separates the core PCB code from the graphical
    user interface.  In this release, two GUI HID's
    are supported, gtk and lesstif.  In addition,
    there are HID exporters for postscript and
    encapsulated postscript, RS-274-X (gerber), bill
    of materials, centroid file, and png/gif/jpeg.
    This represents a major restructuring of the
    code and many months of work.

    Additional changes are:
    </p>
    <UL>
    <LI>
      PCB's actions (the commands which drive the core of the program and
      may be directly accessed by the user) now have the documentation in-line
      in the code and the actions reference section of the manual is 
      extracted from the in-line documentation.  The goal it to provide more
      complete and accurate documentation.  As always the manual is still
      a work in progress but it is getting more complete and up to date.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Fixed a long standing segfault when saving connection data
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Fixed a DRC bug
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Fix some rounding issues when setting sizes.  Hopefully this will address
      the issue with 23.99 mil drills and related problems.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      The html manual is now in one file instead of many files
    </LI>

    <LI>
      The lesstif HID now supports loading of background images to help
      recover a layout which may exist in hardcopy form only.
    </LI>
    </UL>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20060321hid">HID Code Merge</A></H2>
    <p>
      After several months of hard work lead by DJ Delorie, the Human Interface Device
      (HID) version of PCB was merged into CVS on 2006-03-21.  As part of this work,
      DJ has added
      a lesstif GUI and Bill Wilson contributed a tremendous effort to get his GTK
      GUI working in the HID framework.  In addition a new png/gif/jpeg export option
      has been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the HID project was to remove all of the GUI dependent code from the
      core of PCB.  In addition to opening the doors to a future win32 port (volunteers?),
      this should make the core code easier to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This represents a fairly major overhaul of a lot of code so lots of testing would
      be appreciated.
    </p>

    <p>
      A new snapshot release, pcb-20060321, is available.  As always, this is
      a snapshot of a work in progress.
      A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:
      </p>
    <UL>
    <LI>
    Add internal support for more than 8 layers.  By default PCB is still
    compiled for 8 copper layers.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed several minor bugs in the GTK user interface including fixing
    scrolling of the log window, fixed up some of the DRC reporting
    and mm/mil units.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed several key bindings.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Updated refcard.tex to reflect the current set of key bindings.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed some minor bugs which caused compilation problems on some
    systems.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Converted the QFN footprints to hi-res.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Added documentation to the manual for the centroid file format and
    the algorithm used for finding the centroid and rotation.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed a bug so that the initial layer named 'component' is actually
    on the component side of the board and 'solder' is actually on the
    solder side of the board.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed the pin order in the bourns trim pots (~bourns library)
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Added actions and a script to allow command line printing.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Added IPC-7351 recommended footprints for 0201, 0402, etc passives.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed SME5 package.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed a bug which prevented disabling nets from the ratsnest
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed a bug where clearances could be set 1 below the spacing
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed clearline flag so that arcs also have this property.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Speed up rtree searches and other autorouter speedups.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fixed a bug in computation of the closest polygon point.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Use rtrees for polygon handling for speed improvements.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Add a ChangePinName() action.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fix a bug which caused duplicate rats names when manually adding
    rats lines.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Added DRC checks for minimum drill diameter and minimum annular ring.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Add a minimal glossary to the manual
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Fix the author name in the fab drawing
    </LI>

    drawing.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Add "join" to SetFlag, ClrFlag and ChangeFlag.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Added inline documentation for the pcb file syntax.  The manual now
    is up to date and correctly documents the file format.  In addition
    the inline documentation will make it much easier to maintain the
    documentation.
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Remove some broken m4lib footprints
    </LI>

    <LI>
    Put the correct setting for the gschem footprint= attribute in []
    in the library window for the m4 libraries.
    </LI>
    
    </UL>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20060311">File format documentation updated</A></H2>
    <p>
    DJ Delorie has brought the section in the <a href="manual.html">PCB
    manual</a> which covers the file format up to date with the current
    sources.  The documentation source now is in commented contained within
    the source code.  The has the benefit of both making it much easier to
    maintain the documentation as well as reducing duplication.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20050609">Development snapshot 20050609 available</A></H2>
    <p>
      A new snapshot release, pcb-20050609, is available.  As always, this is
      a snapshot of a work in progress.
      A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:
      </p>
    <UL>
    <LI><EM>The GUI is now based on gtk2 instead of Xaw</EM>. This represents
     a fairly major change.  You will now need gtk-2.6 or higher installed
     along with any of its dependencies to build pcb.  On linux
     distributions, it is probably the case that you already have this.
     For *BSD, Solaris, and others, you may want to use NetBSD's pkgsrc
     to help install gtk2 and its dependencies.
     </LI>

     <LI>
     Flags are stored symbolically in the .pcb file.  This is the start
     of moving to support &gt;8 layers.  Please note that &gt;8 layer support
     is not yet available in this snapshot.
     </LI>

     <LI>
     Fixes for gcc-4
     </LI>

     <LI>
     As part of the switch to gtk2, the user customizable menu feature has
     been temporarily broken.  Hopefully this will be fixed by the next
     snapshot.  In addition, the loading of background images has also been
     temporarily broken.
     </LI>
    </UL>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20050315">Development snapshot 20050315 available</A></H2>
    <p>
      A new snapshot release, pcb-20050315, is available.  As always, this is
      a snapshot of a work in progress.  There have been a small
      handful bug fixes and feature additions.
      Thanks to everyone who has provided
      feedback.  Please note, this snapshot uses the same Xaw (Athena
      Widgets) based user interface that pcb has had for quite some time.
      A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:
      </p>
    <UL>
      <LI>Several footprint library fixes including TO-220 parse errors and
        incorrect drill holes on several componenets. </LI>

      <LI>Fixed a crashing bug in the pinout window.</LI>

      <LI>Allow the FAB author to be set via an Xresource to override what
           PCB might have gotten from the gecos information.</LI>

      <LI>Added table of standard drill sizes to the manual.</LI>

      <LI>Fixed a crashing bug when trying to use arrow keys to adjust the scale
          slider in the print dialog box.</LI>

    <H2><A NAME="20050311">GTK version in CVS</A></H2>
    <p>
      March 11, 2005.  Bill Wilson's port of pcb to <a
    href="http://www.gtk.org">gtk</a>
      has been imported into CVS.  As part of this effort, a branch in
      cvs called "pcb-xaw" has been created which contains the Athena Widgets
      (Xaw) version of pcb.  If you are tracking pcb with CVS and you want the
      Xaw version, you will need to use the "-r pcb-xaw" option to cvs when
      updating next time.</p>
     <p>
      This represents a fairly substantial change to pcb and there are a few
      known issues which still need to be addressed.  However, the port is 
      complete enough to try out.  Once some of the key issues are taken care
      of and the port stabilizes a bit, a snapshot release using gtk will be
      released.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many thanks to Bill for all of his work in making this happen.

       This has been an exciting 3 months for PCB.  Many improvements have
       been made in the program as well as additions and improvements to the
       footprint library.  Thanks to everyone who has provided feedback,
       patches, etc.

    <H3>
       Additions/Improvements
    </H3>
    <UL>
      <LI> Expanded DRC checking
      <LI> "Realtime" DRC checking
      <LI> DRC settings are now stored in the board fle
      <LI> Centroid (X-Y) and bill of materials output
      <LI> Dynamic menus.  Users can now customize the menus via a
           site-wide, per-user, or per-project menu resource file.
      <LI> Significant improvements to autorouting of congested designs.
      <LI> Autorouter can now use power planes.
      <LI> Improved appearance in autorouter output.
      <LI> Silk on pads/pins is clipped in RS-274-X output

    <H2><A NAME="20040215">Development snapshot 20040215 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    Febuary 15, 2004.  A new snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    is available.
    pcb-20040215 is the 3rd development snapshot release since moving to
    SourceForge.  This snapshot represents a big step forward in PCB.  
    Anyone following the CVS changes over the last month will have noticed
    a very large number of bug fixes and feature enhancements by harry eaton.
    A partial list of what's new is:
    <UL>
    <LI>Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1.0 mil</LI>
    <LI>Improved DRC checking</LI>
    <LI>Mirroring/rotating of buffers</LI>
    <LI>Undo works on trace optimizations</LI>
    <LI>Fixed polygon undo bugs</LI>
    <LI>Fix arc DRC bugs</LI>
    <LI>Added local measurement for line drawing</LI>
    <LI>Added mode for polygon viewing to help examing planes</LI>
    <LI>Added new footprint libraries (amp, amphenol, bourns, johnstech,
	minicircuits, panasonic)</LI>
    <LI>Added new footprints to the geda library</LI>
    <LI>Other bug fixes</LI>
    </UL>
    Please note that, as with previous snapshots, this snapshot represents
    a work in progress.  Download the snapshot
    from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73743">Files Release section</a>
    of the PCB SourceForge project page.

    <H2><A NAME="20040105">Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1 mil</A></H2>
    <p>
    January 5, 2004.  Harry Eaton has committed a series of changes which
    increase the resolution of PCB.  Prior versions of PCB used 1 mil as the
    fundamental unit.  As packaging and board fabrication technology has
    progressed, this resolution is no longer adequate.  The new internal unit is 0.01
    mil.  Old libraries may still be used and old designs may be opened, but
    the design will be saved in the new hi-resolution format.  This means
    you will not be able to re-open the layout in an older version of PCB.
    </p>
    <p>
    The source tree immediately prior to the hi-resolution changes is tagged
    with "low_res".  To update your CVS tree to the last version of the
    low resolution PCB, use <tt>cvs update -PdA -r low_res</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe that most if not all of the bugs related to this change have been
    worked out, but further independent testing is always useful.

    November 13, 2003.  A snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    has been released and is available from the PCB <A
    HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pcb">Sourceforge 
    Project Summary Page</A>.  This is the second snapshot release
    since moving to sourceforge.  This snapshot includes cygwin and
    Darwin support as well as new QFN footprints, improved documentation
    on how the libraries work and interfacing with
    <A HREF="http://www.geda.seul.org">gEDA</A>, and several bug fixes.
    Many thanks to everyone who has supplied patches and bug reports.
    </p>
    <p>
    As with the previous snapshot, please note that this snapshot
    has not gone through a rigorous
    release engineering cycle but rather is a simple snapshot of a
    work in progress.

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20031111">PCB Ported to Cygwin</A></H2>
    <p>
    November 11, 2003.  PCB should now compile and run "out of the box"
    under cygwin.  You will need Xfree86 installed as well as the same
    set of development tools (gcc, m4, make, tcl/tk) as needed on other
    operating systems.

    <H2><A NAME="20030815">Development snapshot 20030815 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    August 15, 2003.  A snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    has been released and is available from the PCB <A
    HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pcb">Sourceforge 
    Project Summary Page</A>.  We plan on making periodic snapshots
    available to assist those who are unable to use the anonymous CVS
    service.  This will also allow developers of various packaging
    systems to create PCB snapshot packages.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please note that these snapshots have not gone through a rigorous
    release engineering cycle but rather are simple snapshots of a
    work in progress.
