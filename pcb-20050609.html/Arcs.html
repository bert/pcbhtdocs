<h3 class="subsection">Arcs</h4>

<p>An Arc is drawn  with the <em>arc-tool</em>. Get there either by selecting it
from the <em>Tool palette</em> or by pressing <em>&lt;Key&gt;F8</em>. Press <em>Btn1</em> to
define the starting point for the arc.  Drag the mouse towards the desired
end point along the path you want the arc to follow.  The outline of the arc that
will be created is shown on the screen as you move the mouse.  Arcs are always
forced to be 90 degrees and have symmetrical length and width ( i.e. they are
a quarter circle).  The next <em>Btn1</em> click creates the arc.  It will have
the same width as new lines (displayed in the status line) and appear on the
active layer. The arc leaves the starting point towards the cross hair along
the axis whose distance from the cross hair is largest.  Normally this means that
if you drag along the path you want the arc to follow, you'll get what you
want.  If the grid is set to the arc radius, then the two distances will be
equal and you won't be able to get all of the possible directions.  If this
is thwarting your desires, reduce the grid spacing (<em>!Shift&lt;Key&gt;G</em>) and
try again.
