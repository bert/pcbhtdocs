<h3 class="subsection">Lines</h4>

<p>To draw new lines you have to be in <em>line-mode</em>. Get there either by
selecting it from the <em>Tool palette</em> or by pressing <em>&lt;Key&gt;F2</em>. 
Each successive <em>notify</em> event creates a new line. The
adjustment to 45 degree lines is done automatically if it is selected from the
<em>Display</em> menu. You can toggle the 45 degree mode setting by
pressing the <em>&lt;Key&gt;.</em> (That is the period key). When 45 degree enforcement
is turned on there are three distinct modes of line creation: a single
line on the closest 45 degree vector towards the cross hair (but not necessarily
actually ending at the cross hair), two lines created such that the first leaves
the start point on a 90 degree vector and the second arrives at the cross hair
on a 45 degree vector, and finally two lines created such that the first leaves
the start point on a 45 degree vector and the second arrives at the cross hair
on a 90 degree vector.  These last two modes always connect all the way from
the start and end points, and all lines have angles in 45 degree multiples. 
The <em>&lt;Key&gt;/</em> cycles through the three modes.  The status line shows a
text icon to indicate which of the modes is active and the lines following
the cross hair motion show the outline of the line(s) that will actually be created. 
Press <em>&lt;Key&gt;Escape</em> to leave line-mode.

   <p><em>&lt;Key&gt;l</em>, <em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;l</em> and the entries in the
<em>Sizes</em> menu change the initial width of new lines.  This width is also
displayed in the status line.
