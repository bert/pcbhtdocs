<h2 class="unnumbered">History</h2>

<p><code>Pcb</code> is a handy tool for laying out printed circuit
boards.

   <p><code>Pcb</code> was first written by Thomas Nau for an Atari ST in 1990 and
ported to <code>UNIX</code> and <code>X11</code> in 1994. 
It was not intended as a professional layout system,
but as a tool which supports people who do some
home-developing of hardware.

   <p>The second release 1.2 included menus for the first time. This made
<code>Pcb</code> easier to use and thus a more important tool.

   <p>Release 1.3 introduced undo for highly-destructive commands,
more straightforward action handling and scalable fonts. Layer-groups
were introduced to group signal-layers together.

   <p>Release 1.4 provided support for add-on device drivers. 
Two layers (the solder and the component side)
were added to support SMD elements. The handling of libraries
was also improved in 1.4.1. Support for additional devices like
GERBER plotters started in 1.4.4. The undo feature was expanded
and the redo-feature added in 1.4.5.

   <p>harry eaton took over pcb development beginning with Release 1.5,
although he contributed some code beginning with Release 1.4.3

   <p>Release 1.5 provides support for rats-nest generation from simple net
lists.  It also allows for automatic clearances around pins that pierce
a polygon.  A variety of other enhancements including a Gerber RS-274-X
driver and NC drill file generation have also been added.

   <p>Release 1.6 provides automatic screen updates of changed regions. 
This should eliminate most of the need for the redraw ((<em>R</em> key). 
Also some changes to what order items under the cursor are selected
were made for better consistency - it is no longer possible to
accidentally move a line or line point that is completely obscured
by a polygon laying over top of it.  Larger objects on the upper
most layers can be selected ahead of smaller objects on lower layers. 
These changes make operations more intuitive.  A new mode of line
creation was added that creates two line on 45 degree angles
with a single click. The actual outline of the prospective line(s) are
now shown during line creation.  An arc creation mode was added. 
Drawn arcs are quarter circles and can be useful for high frequency
controlled impedance lines.  (You can have eighth circle arc if the
source is compiled with -DARC45, but be aware that the ends of such
arcs can never intersect a grid point).  Two new flags for pins and
vias were created - one indicates that the pin or via is purely a
drill hole and has no copper annulus.  You can only toggle this flag
for vias - for elements, it must be an integral part of the element
definition.  The other flag controls whether the pad will be round
or octagonal.  There is also now a feature for converting the contents
of a buffer into an element.

   <p>Release 1.6.1 added the ability to make groups of action commands bound to
a single X11 event to be undone by a single undo. Also a simple design rule
checker was added - it checks for minimum spacing and overlap rules. Plus
many fixes for bugs introduced with the many changes of 1.6

   <p>Release 1.7 added support for routing tracks through polygons without touching
them. It also added support for unplated drill files, and drawing directly
on the silk layer. A Netlist window for easily working with netlist was also added.

   <p>Release 2.0 adds an auto-router, a new simpler library mechanism, much improved
support for graphically creating (and editing) elements, viewable solder-mask
layers (and editing), snap to pins and pads, netlist entry by drawing rats, element
files (and libraries) that can contain whole sub-layouts, metric grids, improved
user interface, a GNU autoconf/automake based build system, and a host
of other improvements.

   <br>who provided all sorts of help including porting <code>Pcb</code> to<br>
   several operating systems and platforms, bug fixes, library enhancement,
user interface suggestions and more. In addition to these people,
many others donated time for bug-fixing and
other important work. Some of them can be identified in the source code
files.  Thanks to all of them. If you feel left out of this list, I
apologize; please send me an e-mail and I'll try to correct the omission.
