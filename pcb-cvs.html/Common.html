   <p>There are several keystrokes and button events referring to an <em>object</em>
without identifying its type. Here's a list of them:

   <p><em>&lt;Btn1&gt;</em> creates (or deletes)  an object depending on the
current mode.

   <p><em>&lt;Key&gt;BackSpace</em> or <em>&lt;Key&gt;Delete</em> removes the visible
object at the cursor location. When more than one object exists at the
location, the order of removal is: via, line, text, polygon and
element. The drawn layer order also affects the search - whatever is
top - most (except elements) is affected before lower items.  Basically
all this means that what is removed is probably just what you expect. 
If for some reason it isn't, undo and try again. 
Only one object is removed for each keystroke. If two or more
of the same type match, the newest one is removed.

   <p>Use <em>&lt;Key&gt;s</em> and <em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;s</em> to change the size (width)
of lines, arcs, text objects, pins, pads and vias, or to toggle the style
of polygons (whether pins and vias automatically have clearances).

   <p><em>&lt;Key&gt;n</em> changes the name of pins, pads, vias, the
string of a text object, or the currently displayed label of an element.

   <p><em>&lt;Key&gt;m</em> moves the line, arc, or polygon under the cross hair to the
active layer if it wasn't on that layer already.

   <p><em>&lt;Key&gt;u</em> (undo) recovers from an unlimited number of operations
such as creating, removing, moving, copying, selecting etc. It works like
you'd expect even if you're in the midst of creating something.

   <p><em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;r</em> restores the last undone operation provided no other
changes have been made since the undo was performed.

   <p><em>&lt;Key&gt;tab</em> changes the board side you are viewing.
