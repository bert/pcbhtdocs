<h2 class="chapter">8 Library Creation</h2>

<p>This chapter provides a detailed look at how footprint libraries are
created and used.  The chapter is split into two section, the first
section covers the "old" style libraries which use the <code>m4</code> macro
processor and the second section covers the "new" style libraries.

   <p>Despite the names "old" and "new", both styles of libraries are useful
and the "old" style should not be discounted because of its name.  The
advantage of the old style libraries is that one can define a family of
footprints, say a DIP package, and then quickly produce all the members
of that family.  Because the individual packages make use of a base
definition, corrections made to the base definition propagate to all the
members of a family.  The primary drawback to using this library
approach is that the effort to create a single footprint is more than a
graphical interface and may take even longer if the user has not used
the <code>m4</code> macro language previously.

   <p>The new style of footprint libraries stores each footprint in its own
file.  The footprints are created graphically by placing pads and then
converting a group of pads to a component.  This library method has the
advantage of being quick to learn and it is easily to build single
footprints quickly.  If you are building a family of parts, however, the
additional effort in creating each one individually makes this approach
undesirable.  In addition, creating a part with a large pin count
can be quite tedious when done by hand.

<h3 class="section">8.1 Old Style (m4) Libraries</h3>

<p>The old style libraries for pcb use the <code>m4</code> macro processor to
allow the definition of a family of parts.  There are several files
associated with the old style library.  The file <span class="file">common.m4</span> is the
top level file associated with the library.  <span class="file">common.m4</span> defines a
few utility macros which are used by other portions of the library,
and then includes a predefined set of library files (the lines like
<code>include(geda.inc)</code>).

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.1 Overview of Oldlib Operation</h4>

<p>The big picture view of the old style library system is that the library
is simply a collection of macro definitions.  The macros are written in
the <code>m4</code> macro language.  An example of a macro and what it expands
to is the following.  One of the predefined footprints in the library
which comes with PCB is the <code>PKG_SO8</code> macro.  Note that all the
footprint macros begin with <code>PKG_</code>.  For this particular example,
<code>PKG_SO8</code> is a macro for an 8-pin small outline surface mount
package.  All of the footprint macros take 3 arguments.  The first is the
canonical name of the footprint on the board.  In this case "SO8" is an
appropriate name.  The second argument is the reference designator on
the board such as "U1" or "U23".  The third and final argument is the
value.  For an integrated circuit this is usually the part number such
as "MAX4107" or "78L05" and for a component such as a resistor or
capacitor it is the resistance or capacitance.  The complete call to the
macro in our example is <span class="samp">PKG_SO8(SO8, U1, MAX4107)</span>.  When
processed by <code>m4</code> using the macros defined in the PCB library, this
macro expands to
<pre class="example">     Element(0x00 "SO8" "U1" "MAX4107" 146 50 3 100 0x00)
     (
     	Pad(10 25 38 25 20 "1" 0x00)
     	Pad(10 75 38 75 20 "2" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 125 38 125 20 "3" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 175 38 175 20 "4" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 175 242 175 20 "5" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 125 242 125 20 "6" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 75 242 75 20 "7" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 25 242 25 20 "8" 0x100)
     	ElementLine(0 0 151 0 10)
     	ElementArc(126 0 25 25 0 180 10)
     	ElementLine(101 0 252 0 10)
     	ElementLine(252 0 252 200 10)
     	ElementLine(252 200 0 200 10)
     	ElementLine(0 200 0 0 10)
     	Mark(29 25)
     )
</pre>
   <p>which is the actual definition of the footprint that the PCB program
works with.  As a user of PCB the only time you will need or want to run
<code>m4</code> directly is when you are debugging a new library addition.  In
normal operation, the calls to <code>m4</code> are made by helper scripts that
come with PCB.

   <p>Tools such as <code>gsch2pcb</code> (used to interface the gEDA schematic
capture program to PCB layout) will call <code>m4</code> to produce an initial
PCB layout that includes all the components on a schematic.  In
addition, when manually instantiating parts from within PCB, <code>m4</code>
will be called by PCB's helper scripts to produce the footprints.

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.2 The Library Scripts</h4>

<p>There are several scripts that are used for processing the m4
libraries.  This section briefly describes these scripts and details how
they are used by PCB.

<h5 class="subsubsection">8.1.2.1 Scripts Used During Compilation</h5>

<p>The scripts described in this section are used during compilation of
PCB.  They are run automatically by the build system, but are described
here to help document the complete library processing that occurs. 
During the build of PCB, the following actions are taken.  The
<code>CreateLibrary.sh</code> script is run to produce an M4 "frozen file". 
This frozen file is simply a partially processed M4 input file which can
be loaded by M4 more quickly than the original input file.

   <p>A typical call to <code>CreateLibrary.sh</code> used during the compilation of
PCB is:
<pre class="example">     ./CreateLibrary.sh -I . pcblib ./common.m4 TTL_74xx_DIL.m4
     connector.m4 crystal.m4 generic.m4 genericsmt.m4 gtag.m4
     jerry.m4 linear.m4 logic.m4 lsi.m4 memory.m4 optical.m4 pci.m4
     resistor_0.25W.m4 resistor_adjust.m4 resistor_array.m4
     texas_inst_amplifier.m4 texas_inst_voltage_reg.m4
     transistor.m4 geda.m4
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="samp">-I .</span> says to search in the current directory for the
<span class="file">.m4</span> files.  The output frozen file is <span class="file">pcblib</span>.  The main
<span class="file">common.m4</span> file is listed as well as all of the <span class="file">*.m4</span> files
which define the components in the library.

   <p>In addition, a library contents file is created during the build with
the <code>CreateLibraryContents.sh</code> script. 
A typical call to <code>CreateLibrary.sh</code> used during the compilation of
PCB is:
<pre class="example">     ./CreateLibraryContents.sh -I . ./common.m4 TTL_74xx_DIL.list
     connector.list crystal.list generic.list genericsmt.list gtag.list
     jerry.list linear.list logic.list lsi.list memory.list optical.list
     pci.list resistor_0.25W.list resistor_adjust.list resistor_array.list
     texas_inst_amplifier.list texas_inst_voltage_reg.list transistor.list
     geda.list &gt; pcblib.contents
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="file">pcblib.contents</span> file is used by the PCB program to define the
libraries and components which will be displayed when you bring up
the library window from within PCB.  An example of part of the
<span class="file">pcblib.contents</span> file is:
<pre class="example">     TYPE=~TTL 74xx DIL
     7400_dil:N:7400:4 dual-NAND
     7401_dil:N:7401:4 dual-NAND OC
     7402_dil:N:7402:4 dual-NOR
     TYPE=~geda
     geda_DIP6:DIP6:DIP6:Dual in-line package, narrow (300 mil)
     geda_DIP8:DIP8:DIP8:Dual in-line package, narrow (300 mil)
     geda_DIP14:DIP14:DIP14:Dual in-line package, narrow (300 mil)
     geda_ACY300:ACY300:ACY300:Axial non-polar component,
</pre>
   <p>The <code>TYPE=</code> lines define the library name that will show up in the
library window in PCB.  The other lines define the actual components in
the library.

<h5 class="subsubsection">8.1.2.2 Scripts Used by PCB at Runtime</h5>

<p>When PCB is first executed, it makes a call to the
<code>ListLibraryContents.sh</code> script.  This script provides the PCB
program with the contents of the library contents file created when PCB
was compiled.  A typical call to <code>ListLibraryContents.sh</code> is
<pre class="example">     ../lib/ListLibraryContents.sh .:/tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib pcblib
</pre>
   <p>This command says to search the path
<span class="samp">.:/tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib</span> for a file called
<span class="file">pcblib.contents</span> (the <span class="file">.contents</span> part is added
automatically) and display the contents of the file. 
PCB parses this output and generates the library window entries.

   <p>When you pick a library component from the library window, PCB calls the
<code>QueryLibrary.sh</code> script to actually pull the footprint into the
layout.  For example, when the ACY300 component is selected from the
<code>~geda</code> library, the generated call may be:

<pre class="example">     /tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib/QueryLibrary.sh
     .:/tmp/pcb-20030903/src/../lib pcblib geda_ACY300 ACY300
     ACY300
</pre>
   <p>If you were to run this command by hand you would see the PCB code for
the element:
<pre class="example">     Element(0x00 "Axial non-polar component," "" "ACY300" 245 70 0 100 0x00)
     (
     	Pin(0 25 50 20 "1" 0x101)
     	Pin(300 25 50 20 "2" 0x01)
     
     	ElementLine(0 25 75 25 10)
     	ElementLine(225 25 300 25 10)
     
     	ElementLine(75 0 225 0 10)
     	ElementLine(225 0 225 50 10)
     	ElementLine(225 50 75 50 10)
     	ElementLine(75 50 75 0 10)
     
     #       ElementArc(X1 Y 50 50 270 180 10)
     #       ElementArc(X2 Y 50 50 90 180 10)
     
     	Mark(75 25)
     )
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">8.1.3 Creating an Oldlib Footprint</h4>

<p>This section provides a complete example of defining a family of
footprints using the M4 style library.  As a vehicle for this example, a
family of footprints for surface mount resistors and capacitors will be
developed.   The file <span class="file">example.inc</span> should have been installed on
your system as <span class="file">$prefix/share/examples/oldlib/example.inc</span> where
<span class="file">$prefix</span> is often times <span class="file">/usr/local</span>.

   <p>The <span class="file">example.inc</span> file defines a macro called
<code>COMMON_PKG_RCSMT</code> which is a generic definition for a surface
mount footprint with two identical, rectangular pads.  This macro will
be called with different parameters to fill out the family of parts. 
The arguments to the <code>COMMON_PKG_RCSMT</code> are:
<pre class="example">     # -------------------------------------------------------------------
     # the definition for surface mount resistors and capacitors
     # $1: canonical name
     # $2: name on PCB
     # $3: value
     # $4: pad width   (in direction perpendicular to part)
     # $5: pad length  (in direction parallel with part)
     # $6: pad spacing (center to center)
     # $7: distance from edge of pad to silk (in direction
     #     perpendicular to part)
     # $8: distance from edge of pad to silk (in direction parallel
     #     with part)
     # $9: Set to "no" to skip silk screen on the sides of the part
</pre>
   <pre class="example">     define(`COMMON_PKG_RCSMT',
     	`define(`XMIN', `eval( -1*`$6'/2 - `$5'/2 - `$8')')
     	define(`XMAX', `eval(  `$6'/2 + `$5'/2 + `$8')')
     	define(`YMIN', `eval(-1*`$4'/2 - `$7')')
     	define(`YMAX', `eval(   `$4'/2 + `$7')')
     Element(0x00 "$1" "$2" "$3" eval(XMIN+20) eval(YMAX+20) 0 100 0x00)
     (
     	ifelse(0, eval($4&gt;$5),
     	# Pads which have the perpendicular pad dimension less
     	# than or equal to the parallel pad dimension
     	Pad(eval(-1*(   $6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0
     	    eval((-1*$6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0 eval($4) "1" 0x100)
     	Pad(eval(-1*(-1*$6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0
     	    eval((   $6 + $5 - $4)/2) 0 eval($4) "2" 0x100)
     	,
     	# Pads which have the perpendicular pad dimension greater
     	# than or equal to the parallel pad dimension
     	Pad(eval(-1*$6/2) eval(-1*($4 - $5)/2)
     	    eval(-1*$6/2)  eval(($4 - $5)/2) eval($5) "1" 0x100)
     	Pad(eval(   $6/2) eval(-1*($4 - $5)/2)
     	    eval(   $6/2)  eval(($4 - $5)/2) eval($5) "2" 0x100)
     	)
     
     	# silk screen
     	# ends
     	ElementLine(XMIN YMIN XMIN YMAX 10)
     	ElementLine(XMAX YMAX XMAX YMIN 10)
     	# sides
     ifelse($9,"no",
     	#skip side silk
     	,
     	ElementLine(XMIN YMIN XMAX YMIN 10)
     	ElementLine(XMAX YMAX XMIN YMAX 10)
     )
     	Mark(0 0)
     )')
</pre>
   <p>Note that the part has been defined with the mark located at
<code>(0,0)</code> and that the pads have been placed with the mark at the
common centroid of the footprint.  While not a requirement, this is
highly desirable when developing a library that will need to interface
with a pick and place machine used for factory assembly of a board.

   <p>The final part of <span class="file">example.inc</span> defines particular versions of the
generic footprint we have created.  These particular versions correspond
to various industry standard package sizes.
<pre class="example">     # 0402 package
     #
     # 30x30 mil pad, 15 mil metal-metal spacing=&gt;
     # 15 + 15 + 15 = 45 center-to-center
     define(`PKG_RC0402',
       `COMMON_PKG_RCSMT(`$1', `$2', `$3', 30, 30, 45, 0, 10, "no")')
     
     # 0603 package
     #
     # 40x40 mil pad, 30 mil metal-metal spacing=&gt;
     #  30 + 20 + 20 = 70 center-to-center
     define(`PKG_RC0603',
       `COMMON_PKG_RCSMT(`$1', `$2', `$3', 40, 40, 70, 10, 10)')
     
     # 1206 package
     #
     # 40x60 mil pad, 90 mil metal-metal spacing=&gt;
     #  90 + 20 + 20 = 130 center-to-center
     define(`PKG_RC1206',
       `COMMON_PKG_RCSMT(`$1', `$2', `$3', 60, 40, 130, 10, 10)')
</pre>
   <p>At this point, the <span class="file">example.inc</span> file could be used by third party
tools such as <code>gsch2pcb</code>.  However to fully integrate our
footprints into PCB we need to create the <span class="file">example.m4</span> and
<span class="file">example.list</span> files.  The <span class="file">example.m4</span> file defines
descriptions for the new footprints.
<pre class="example">     define(`Description_my_RC0402',
       ``Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (0402)'')
     define(`Description_my_RC0603',
       ``Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (0603)'')
     define(`Description_my_RC1206',
       ``Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (1206)'')
</pre>
   <p>Finally we need to create the <span class="file">example.list</span> file.
<pre class="example">     my_RC0402:RC0402:RES0402
     my_RC0402:RC0402:CAP0402
     my_RC0603:RC0603:RES0603
     my_RC0603:RC0603:CAP0603
     my_RC1206:RC1206:RES1206
     my_RC1206:RC1206:CAP1206
</pre>
   <p>The first field in the list file has the name corresponding to the
Description definitions in <span class="file">example.m4</span>.  The second field is the
template name which corresponds to the macros <code>PKG_*</code> we defined in
<span class="file">example.inc</span> with the leading <code>PKG_</code> removed.  It is the
second field which controls what footprint will actually appear on the
board.  The final
field is the name of the part type on the board.  The first line in our
<span class="file">example.list</span> file will produce a menu entry in the library window
that reads:
<pre class="example">     CAP0402, Standard SMT resistor/capacitor (0402)
</pre>
   <p>The <code>CAP0402</code> portion comes directly from the third field in
<code>example.list</code> and the longer description comes from descriptions
macros in <code>example.m4</code>.  Please note that any extra white space
at the end of a line in the <span class="file">.list</span> files will cause them to
not work properly.

<h4 class="subsection">8.1.4 Troubleshooting Old Style Libraries</h4>

<p>A powerful technique to help debug problems with libraries is to invoke
the <code>m4</code> processor directly.  This approach will provide error
output which is not visible from within PCB.  The following example
shows how one might try to debug an 8 pin small outline (SO8) package.  The
macro name for the package is PKG_SO8.  In this example, the
canonical name that is to be associated with the part is SO8, the
reference designator is U1, and the value is MAX4107 (the part number).

<pre class="example">     echo "PKG_SO8(SO8, U1, MAX4107)" | \
        gm4 common.m4 - | \
        awk '/^[ \t]*$/ {next} {print}' | \
        more
</pre>
   <p>The <code>awk</code> call simply removes blank lines which make the output
hard to read.

   <p>For this particular example, the output is:
<pre class="example">     Element(0x00 "SO8" "U1" "MAX4107" 146 50 3 100 0x00)
     (
     	Pad(10 25 38 25 20 "1" 0x00)
     	Pad(10 75 38 75 20 "2" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 125 38 125 20 "3" 0x100)
     	Pad(10 175 38 175 20 "4" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 175 242 175 20 "5" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 125 242 125 20 "6" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 75 242 75 20 "7" 0x100)
     	Pad(214 25 242 25 20 "8" 0x100)
     	ElementLine(0 0 151 0 10)
     	ElementArc(126 0 25 25 0 180 10)
     	ElementLine(101 0 252 0 10)
     	ElementLine(252 0 252 200 10)
     	ElementLine(252 200 0 200 10)
     	ElementLine(0 200 0 0 10)
     	Mark(29 25)
     )
</pre>
   <h3 class="section">8.2 New Style Libraries</h3>

<p>Footprints for the new style library are created graphically using the
PCB program.  A single footprint is saved in each file.

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.1 Creating Newlib Footprints</h4>

<p>To create
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Start PCB with an empty layout. 
<li>Make the component layer active. 
<li>For a leaded part, select the via tool and place vias where the
pads for the part should go.  For surface mount pads, draw line
segments.  Note that until the footprint is completed, the surface
mount pads will remain rounded.  Currently a rectangle or polygon
may not be used as a pad. 
<li>For each via and line segment which will become a pad, select it,
right-click to bring up the popup menu and choose "edit name".  Enter
the pin number and press enter.  Alternatively, you can use the "n"
hotkey to activate the rename command. 
<li>Make the silk layer active. 
<li>Using the line and arc tools, draw a silk screen outline for the
part. 
<li>Using the selection tool, select all of the pins and silk screen
for the part. 
<li>Place the pointer above the reference point for the part.  This is
typically the common centroid.  Keeping the pointer there, right-click
to bring up the popup menu and choose "convert
selection to element". 
<li>At this point, the vias, line segments, and silk screen will have
been converted to an element.  To change any of the line segments to
have square ends rather than round ends, select the pads by holding
down the shift key and clicking each pad with the center mouse button. 
Now under the Select menu, "Change square-flag of selected objects"
section, choose "Pins". 
<li>Select the element, right-click to bring up the popup menu, and
choose "Copy Selection to Buffer".  Now left-click on the center of
the new element. 
<li>Under the buffer menu, choose "save buffer elements to file" to
save the new footprint to a file. 
<li>Press ESC to exit from buffer mode.
        </ol>

<h4 class="subsection">8.2.2 Modifying Newlib Footprints</h4>

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>In the <code>Pcb</code> program, instantiate the footprint you wish to modify. 
<li>Using the selection tool, select the footprint. 
<li>Now left-click on the selected element, this brings up a popup menu, choose

<li>Under the buffer menu, choose "break buffer element to pieces",
and then left-click to place the broken apart footprint to an open area of
the layout.  Note that you must use the items under the buffer menu, the
items with the same names in the popup menu do not work. 
<li>Make your desired modifications to the footprint and then convert
the pieces back to an element using the same procedure as when starting
from scratch on a new footprint.
