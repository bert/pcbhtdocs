<h3 class="section">2.7 Polygons</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's useful to fill large areas with solid copper. 
The way to do this is with polygons. 
Polygons can be created in either the polygon mode or the rectangle mode. 
In the polygon mode, you'll have to define each corner of the polygon
with a mouse click (<em>Btn1</em>). When the last point is clicked
exactly on top of the starting point, the polygon is finished. 
Since this can be hard to do, the <em>Shift-P</em> key will enter the
final point for you, closing the polygon. 
If the 45 degree angle restriction is turned on
and you try to close the polygon when it is not possible, you'll get a
warning instead. If you haven't finished entering a polygon, but want to
undo one (or more) of the points that you've already defined, use the
undo command (<em>U</em> key).

   <p>With the rectangle tool, defining
the two diagonally opposite corners is sufficient, but of course the resulting
polygon is a rectangle. 
Like lines, a polygon can by edited by deleting, inserting and moving the points
that define it. Pins and vias <em>always</em> clear through polygons without
touching them when first positioned. You must add a thermal with the thermal
tool in order to connect pins and vias to polygons. Thermals can be added and removed by
clicking <em>Btn1</em> with the thermal tool over the pin or via. 
The thermal tool always
places a thermal to polygons on the active layer, so if the tool doesn't
seem to work, it's probably because the polygon you want to touch is not
on the active layer.

   <p><code>Pcb</code> is capable of handling complex polygons, but
using a number of simpler ones improves performance of the connection tracing code. 
You also must be careful not to create polygons that touch or overlap themselves. 
The fabricated board may not look the way you expect if you violate this
principle. It is always ok to have two (or more) polygons touch or overlap
each other, but not for points within the same polygon to do so.

   <p>The great advantage to this new polygon behavior is that simple or complex ground
and/or power planes can be easily made with polygons and seen on the screen. 
If you don't want this auto-clearance behavior, or you load a layout created by
an early version of <code>Pcb</code>, the old behavior
(shorts to all piercing pins and vias) is available.  A <span class="samp">ChangeSize</span>
operation (<em>S</em> key) toggles a polygon between the new and old polygon/pin
behavior.
