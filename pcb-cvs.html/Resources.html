<h3 class="section">Non-Standard X11 Application Resources</h3>

<p>In addition to the toolkit resources, <code>Pcb</code> defines the
following resources:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>absoluteGrid (boolean)</code>
     <dd>Selects if either the grid is relative to the position where it has changed
last or absolute, the default, to the origin (0,0).

     <br><dt><code>alignmentDistance (dimension)</code>
     <dd>Specifies the distance between the boards outline to the alignment targets.

     <br><dt><code>allDirectionLines (boolean)</code>
     <dd>Enables (default) or disables clipping of new lines to 45 degree angles.

     <br><dt><code>backgroundImage (string)</code>
     <dd>If specified, this image will be drawn as the background for the
board.  The purpose of this option is to allow you to use a scan of an
existing layout as a prototype for your new layout.  To do this, there
are some limitations as to what this image must be.  The image must be
a PPM binary image (magic number <code>P6</code>).  It must have a maximum
pixel value of 255 or less (i.e. no 16-bit images).  It must represent
the entire board, as it will be scaled to fit the board dimensions
exactly.  Note that it may be scaled unevenly if the image doesn't
have the same aspect ratio of your board.  You must ensure that the
image does not use more colors than are available on your system
(mostly this is for pseudo-color displays, like old 8-bit displays). 
For best results, I suggest the following procedure using The Gimp:
Load your image (any type).  Image-&gt;Scale if needed. 
Image-&gt;Colors-&gt;Curves and for each of Red, Green, and Blue channel
move the lower left point up to about the 3/4 line (value 192).  This
will make your image pale so it doesn't interfere with the traces
you'll be adding.  Image-&gt;Mode-&gt;Indexed and select, say, 32 colors
with Normal F-S dithering.  File-&gt;Save As, file type by extension,
use <code>.ppm</code> as the extension.  Select Raw formatting.

     <br><dt><code>backupInterval (int)</code>
     <dd><code>Pcb</code> has an automatic backup feature which saves the current data
every n seconds. The default is <em>300</em> seconds. A value of zero disables
the feature. The backup file is named <code>/tmp/PCB.%i.backup</code> by
default (this may have been changed at compilation time via the
<code>BACKUP_NAME</code>
variable in <code>globalconfig.h</code>). 
<em>%i</em> is replaced by the process ID. 
See also, the command-line option <em>-backup</em>.

     <br><dt><code>Bloat (dimension)</code>
     <dd>Specifies the minimum spacing design rule in mils.

     <br><dt><code>charactersPerLine (int)</code>
     <dd><code>Pcb</code> uses this value to determine the page width when creating lists. 
N, the number of characters per line, defaults to <em>80</em>. 
See also, the command-line option <em>-c</em>.

     <br><dt><code>connectedColor (color)</code>
     <dd>All pins, vias, lines and rectangles which are selected during a connection
search are drawn with this color. The default value is determined by
<em>XtDefaultForeground</em>.

     <br><dt><code>cross hairColor (color)</code>
     <dd>This color is used to draw the cross hair cursor. The color is a result of
a <em>XOR</em> operation with the contents of the Layout area. The result
also depends on the default colormap of the <code>X11</code> server because only
the colormap index is used in the boolean operation and <code>Pcb</code> doesn't
create its own colormap. The default setting is <em>XtDefaultForeground</em>.

     <br><dt><code>elementColor (color)</code>
     <dd><dt><code>elementSelectedColor (color)</code>
     <dd>The elements package part is drawn in these colors, for normal and selected
mode, respectively, which both default to <em>XtDefaultForeground</em>.

     <br><dt><code>elementCommand (string)</code>
     <dd><code>Pcb</code> uses a user defined command to read element files. This resources
is used to set the command which is executed by the users default shell. 
Two escape sequences are defined to pass the selected filename (%f) and the
current search path (%p). The command must write the element data
to its standard output. The default value is
     <pre class="example">              M4PATH="%p";export M4PATH;echo 'include(%f)' | m4
          </pre>
     Using the GNU version of <code>m4</code> is highly recommended. 
See also, the command-line option <em>-lelement</em>.

     <br><dt><code>elementPath (string)</code>
     <dd>A colon separated list of directories or commands (starts with '|'). 
The path is passed to the program specified in <em>elementCommand</em> together
with the selected element name. A specified command will be executed in order
to create entries for the fileselect box. It must write its results to
<em>stdout</em> one entry per line. 
See also, the user-command <em>le[!]</em>.

     <br><dt><code>fileCommand (string)</code>
     <dd>The command is executed by the user's default shell whenever existing layout
files are loaded. Data is read from the command's standard output. 
Two escape sequences may be specified to pass the selected filename (%f)
and the current search path (%p). The default value is:
     <pre class="example">              cat %f
          </pre>
     See also, the command-line option <em>-lfile</em>.

     <br><dt><code>filePath (string)</code>
     <dd>A colon separated list of directories or commands (starts with '|'). 
The path is passed to the program specified in <em>fileCommand</em> together
with the selected filename. A specified command will be executed in order
to create entries for the fileselect box. It must write its results to
<em>stdout</em> one entry per line. 
See also, the user-command <em>l[!]</em>.

     <br><dt><code>fontCommand (string)</code>
     <dd>Loading new symbol sets also is handled by an external command. You again
may pass the selected filename and the current search path by passing
%f and %p in the command string. Data is read from the commands standard
output. This command defaults to
     <pre class="example">              cat %f
          </pre>
     See also, the command-line option <em>-lfont</em>.

     <br><dt><code>fontFile (string)</code>
     <dd>The default font for new layouts is read from this file which is searched
in the directories as defined by the resource <em>fontPath</em>. 
Searching is only performed if the filename does not contain a directory
component. 
The default filename is <code>default_font</code>. 
See also, the command-line option <em>-fontfile</em>.

     <br><dt><code>fontPath (string)</code>
     <dd>This resource, a colon separated list of directories, defines the searchpath
for font files. See also, the resource <em>fontFile</em>.

     <br><dt><code>grid (int)</code>
     <dd>This resources defines the initial value of one cursor step. It defaults
to <em>100 mil</em> and any changes are saved together with the layout data.

     <br><dt><code>gridColor (color)</code>
     <dd>This color is used to draw the grid. The color is a result of
a <em>INVERT</em> operation with the contents of the Layout area. The result
also depends on the default colormap of the <code>X11</code> server because only
the colormap index is used in the boolean operation and <code>Pcb</code> doesn't
create its own colormap. The default setting is <em>XtDefaultForeground</em>.

     <br><dt><code>elementColor (color)</code>
     <dd>Elements located on the opposite side of the board are drawn in this color. 
The default is <em>XtDefaultForeground</em>.

     <br><dt><code>layerColor1..MAX_LAYER (color)</code>
     <dd><dt><code>layerSelectedColor1..MAX_LAYER (color)</code>
     <dd>These resources define the drawing colors of the different layers in
normal and selected state. All values are preset to <em>XtDefaultForeground</em>.

     <br><dt><code>layerGroups (string)</code>
     <dd>The argument to this resource is a colon separated list of comma separated
layer numbers (1..MAX_LAYER). All layers within one group are switched on/off
together. The default setting is <em>1:2:3:...:MAX_LAYER</em> which means
all layers are handled separately. Grouping layers one to three looks like
<em>1,2,3:4:...:MAX_LAYER</em>
See also, the command-line option <em>-lg</em>.

     <br><dt><code>layerName1..MAX_LAYER (string)</code>
     <dd>The default name of the layers in a new layout are determined by these
resources. The defaults are empty strings.

     <br><dt><code>libraryCommand (string)</code>
     <dd><code>Pcb</code> uses a command to read element data from libraries. 
The resources is used to set the command which is executed by the users
default shell.  Three escape sequences are defined to pass the selected
filename (%f), the current search path (%p) as well (%a) as the three
parameters <em>template</em>, <em>value</em> and <em>package</em> to the command. 
It must write the element data to its standard output. The default value is
     <pre class="example">              NONE/share/pcb/oldlib/QueryLibrary.sh %p %f %a
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>libraryContentsCommand (string)</code>
     <dd>Similar to <em>libraryCommand</em>, <code>Pcb</code> uses the command specified

     <pre class="example">          	NONE/share/pcb/oldlib/ListLibraryContents.sh %p %f
          </pre>
     is the default.

with the <code>LIBRARYFILENAME</code> variable in <code>globalconfig.h</code>.

     <br><dt><code>libraryPath (string)</code>
     <dd>A colon separated list of directories that will be passed to the commands
specified by <em>elementCommand</em> and <em>elementContentsCommand</em>.

     <br><dt><code>lineThickness (dimension)</code>
     <dd>The value, in the range [1..250] (the range may be changed at compile
time with the <code>MIN_LINESIZE</code> and <code>MAX_LINESIZE</code> variables in
