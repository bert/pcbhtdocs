<h4 class="subsection">3.5.7 Pastebuffer</h4>

<p>The line-stack and element-buffer of former releases have been replaced
by 5 (possibly more or less if changed at compile time
with the <code>MAX_BUFFER</code> variable in <span class="file">globalconfig.h</span>)
multi-purpose buffers that are selected by
<em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;1..MAX_BUFFER</em>. The status line shows which buffer is
the active one. 
You may load data from a file or layout into them. 
Cut-and-paste works too. 
If you followed the instructions earlier in this chapter you should
now have several objects on the screen. Move the cross hair to one of them
and press <em>&lt;Btn3Down&gt;</em> to toggle its selection flag. (If you drag the
mouse while the button is down, a box selection will be attempted instead
of toggling the selection.)  The object
is redrawn in a different color. You also may want to try
moving the pointer while holding the third button down and
release it on a different location. This selects all objects inside the
rectangle and unselects everything else.  If you want to add a box selection
to an existing selection, drag with <em>Mod1&lt;Btn3Down&gt;</em> instead. 
Dragging <em>Shift Mod1&lt;Btn3Down&gt;</em> unselects objects in a box. 
Now change to <em>pastebuffer-mode</em> and select some operations from the
<em>Buffer</em> menu. Copying objects to the buffer is available as
<em>Mod1&lt;Key&gt;c</em> while cutting them uses <em>Mod1&lt;Key&gt;x</em> as
shortcut. Both clear the buffer before new data is added. 
If you use the menu entries, you have to supply a cross hair position by
pressing a mouse button. The objects are attached to the pastebuffer
relative to that cross hair location. 
Element data or PCB data may be merged into an existing layout by loading
the datafiles into the pastebuffer. Both operations are available from
the <em>File</em> menu or as user commands.
