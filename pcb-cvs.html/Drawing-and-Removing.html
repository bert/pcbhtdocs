<h3 class="section">Drawing and Removing Basic Objects</h3>

<p>hace begging gutting here, and do a real-world tutorial example.

   <p>There are several ways of creating new objects: you can draw them yourself,
you can copy an existing object (or selection), or you can load an element from a file or
from the Library window. Each type of object has a particular tool for creating it.

   <p>The active tool can be selected from the tool selectors in the bottom
left corner or by one of the function keys listed earlier in this chapter. 
Each <em>&lt;Btn1&gt;</em> press with the tool tells the application to create
or change the appropriate object or at least take
the first step to do so. Each tools causes the cursor to take
on a unique shape and also causes the corresponding
tool selector button to be highlighted. You can use either cue
to see which tool is active.

   <p>Insert mode provides the capability of inserting new points into existing
polygons or lines. The 45 degree line clipping is now enforced when selected. 
Press and hold the shift key while positioning the new point to only clip
the line segment to the nearer of the two existing points to 45 degrees. 
You can also toggle the 45-degree clipping in the middle of a point
insertion by pressing the <em>&lt;Key&gt;.</em>
If the shift key is not depressed and the 45 degree line clipping mode
is on, both new line segments must be on 45 degree angles - greatly
restricting where the new point may be placed. In some cases this can cause
confusion as to whether an insertion has been started since the two new
lines may be forced to lie parallel on top of the original line until the
pointer is moved far from the end points.

   <p>Removing objects, changing their size or moving them only applies to objects
that are visible when the command is executed.
