<h3 class="section">3.11 Rats Nest</h3>

<p>If you have a netlist that corresponds to the layout you are working on, you
can use the rats-nest feature to add rat-lines to the layout. 
First you will need to load a netlist file (see <em>:rn</em>,
<a href="User-Commands.html#User-Commands">User Commands</a>). 
<em>&lt;Key&gt;w</em> adds rat-lines on the active layer using the current
line thickness shown in the status line (usually you'll want them to be thin lines). 
Only those rat-lines that fill in missing connectivity (since you have
probably routed some connections already) are added. 
If the layout is already completely wired, nothing will be added, and you will
get a message that the wiring is complete.

   <p>Rat-lines are lines having the special property that they only connect to pins and
pads at their end points.  Rat-lines are drawn on the screen with a stippled pattern
to make them easier to identify since they have special behavior and cannot
remain in a completed layout. 
Rat-lines are added in the minimum length straight-line tree pattern
(always ending on pins or pads) that satisfies the missing connectivity in the circuit. 
Used in connection with moves and rotates of the elements, they are extremely useful for
deciding where to place elements on the board. The rat-lines will always automatically
rubberband to the elements whether or not the rubberband mode is on. The only way for
you to move them is by moving the parts they connect to. 
This is because it is never desirable to have the rat-lines disconnected from
their element pins.  Rat-lines will normally criss-cross
all over which gives rise to the name "rats nest" describing a layout connected with
them.  If a SMD pad is unreachable on the active layer, a warning will be issued
about it and the rat-line to that pad will not be generated.

   <p>A common way to use rats nests is to place some
elements on the board, add the rat-lines, and then use a series of moves/rotates of the
elements until the rats nest appears to have minimum tangling.  You may want to iterate this step
several times. Don't worry if the layout looks messy - as long as you can get a sense for whether
the criss-crossing is better or worse as you move things, you're fine. 
After moving some elements around, you may want to optimize the rats nest <em>&lt;Key&gt;o</em>
so that the lines are drawn between the closest points (this can change once you've moved components). 
Adding rat-lines only to selected pads/pins (<em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;w</em>)
is often useful to layout a circuit a little bit at a time. 
Sometimes you'll want to delete all the rat-lines (<em>&lt;Key&gt;e</em>) or
selected rat-lines (<em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;e</em>) in order to reduce confusion. 
With a little practice you'll be able to achieve a near optimal component placement with
the use of a rats nest.

   <p>Rat-lines are not only used for assisting your element placement, they can also help
you to route traces on the board. 
Use the <em>&lt;Key&gt;m</em> to convert a rat-line under the cursor into
a normal line on the active layer. 
Inserting a point into a rat-line will also cause the two new lines to be normal lines
on the board. 
Another way that you can use rat-lines is to
use the <em>&lt;Key&gt;f</em> with the cursor over a pad or pin.  All of the pins and
pads and rat-lines belonging to that net will be highlighted. This is a helpful way to
distinguish one net from the rest of the rats nest.  You can then route those tracks,
turn off the highlighting (<em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;f</em>) and repeat the process. This will work even
if the layer that the rat-lines reside on is made invisible - so only the pins and pads
are highlighted. 
Be sure to erase the rat-lines (<em>&lt;Key&gt;e</em> erases them all) once you've
duplicated their connectivity by adding your own lines. 
When in doubt, the <em>&lt;Key&gt;o</em> will delete only those
rat-lines that are no longer needed.

   <p>If connections exist on the board that are not listed in the netlist when
<em>&lt;Key&gt;w</em> is pressed, warning messages are issued and the affected pins and
pads are drawn in a special <em>warnColor</em> until the next <em>Notify()</em> event. 
If the entire layout agrees completely with the netlist, a message informs you that
the layout is complete and no rat-lines will be added (since none are needed). 
If the layout is complete, but still has rat-lines then you will be warned
that rat-lines remain. If you get no message at all it's probably because some
elements listed in the net list can't be found and where reported in an earlier
message. 
There shouldn't be any rat-lines left in a completed layout, only normal lines.

   <p>The <em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;w</em> is used to add rat-lines to only those missing connections among
the selected pins and pads.  This can be used to add rat-lines in an incremental
manner, or to force a rat-line to route between two points that are not the
closest points within the net. Often it is best to add the rats nest in an incremental fashion, laying
out a sub-section of the board before going further. This is easy to accomplish since
new rat-lines are never added where routed connectivity already makes the necessary
connections.
