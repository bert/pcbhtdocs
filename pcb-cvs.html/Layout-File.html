<h3 class="section">7.2 Layout File Format</h3>

<p>The layout file describes a complete layout including symbols, vias,
elements and layers with lines, rectangles and text. This is the most
complex file of all.

<pre class="example">     File            = Header Font PCBData
     Header          = PCBName [GridData] [CursorData] [PCBFlags] [Groups]

</pre>
     <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">PCBName</span><dd>is used to define the layout's name which is independent of its filename. 
It is displayed in the lower left corner of the main window.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">GridData</span><dd>is optional and is used to save the grid setting and offset which were set
at the time the layout was saved.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">CursorData</span><dd>also is an optional parameter to save the last cursor location and zoom value. 
The real zoom factor is calculated by scale = 1:(2 power value).

     <br><dt><span class="samp">PCBFlags</span><dd>determine how to draw lines and which name of the elements should be
displayed.
     <pre class="example">              bit 4:  do rubberband moves and rotates if set
              bit 5:  display description of elements if set
              bit 6:  display unique name of an element if set
              bit 7:  use absolute grid if set
              bit 8:  don't clip lines to 45 degrees
     </pre>
     <br><dt><span class="samp">Groups</span><dd>Layergroups are saved by using this optional parameter. The only way of
changing them is to use an editor and alter the appropriate line. The
characters <em>c,s</em> identify the component- and solder-side for SMD
objects.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Symbol</span><dd>See the description of font files in this chapter.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Via</span><dd>Vias are always connected to all layers which also means vias are one
logical level ahead of layers. Vias are defined by position, size, name and
by some flags.
     <pre class="example">              bit 0:  always clear
              bit 1:  always set
              bit 2:  set if via was found during a connection search
              bit 4:  set if via is a hole (has no copper annulus)
              bit 5:  display the vias name
              bit 6:  via has been selected
              bit 12: set if via has octagonal shape
              Other bits have special meaning and should not be changed
              by the user.  See const.h for more information
     </pre>
     <br><dt><span class="samp">Element</span><dd>See the description of element files in this chapter.

     <br><dt><span class="samp">Layer</span><dd>A layer is the central object from the user's point of view. It holds all
connections and all text objects. Up to 8 may be used individually. 
Its number, starting with one, and its name are read as arguments.

          <dl>
<dt><span class="samp">Line</span><dd>All lines are identified by their start and endpoints together with their
thickness and some flags. They have to fit a 45 degree scheme.
          <pre class="example">                   bit 2:  set if line was found during a connection search
                   bit 4:  line is a rat-line
                   bit 6:  line has been selected
          </pre>
          <br><dt><span class="samp">Polygon</span><dd>used to fill a larger area with <span class="samp">copper</span>. The coordinates specify the
corners. The flags are:
          <pre class="example">                   bit 2:  set if polygon was found during a connection search
                   bit 4:  polygon is a 1.5 style polygon that automatically clears pins
                   bit 6:  polygon has been selected
          </pre>
          <br><dt><span class="samp">Text</span><dd>You may use text objects to add information to your board. An example would
be naming a connector or marking pin one of it. The position marks the
lower left corner of the string which is also a fix-point for rotations. 
Text directions are independent to those of lines. They are counted from
zero to three with a meaning of zero to 270 degree rotations counter-clockwise. 
The scaling value is a positive integer which determines a zoom factor in
percent.
          <pre class="example">                   bit 6:  the text has been selected
                   bit 7:  the text is on the solder (back) side of the board
                   bit 10: the text is on the silkscreen layer
