<h2 class="chapter">User Commands</h2>

<p>The entering of user-commands is initiated by the action routine
<em>Command()</em> (the <code>(":")</code> character) and finished by either
<em>&lt;Key&gt;Return</em>
or <em>&lt;Key&gt;Escape</em> to confirm or to abort. These two key-bindings
cannot be changed from the resource file. 
The triggering event, normally a key press, is ignored. 
The input area will replace the bottom statusline. It pops
up when <em>Command()</em> is called. The arguments of the user-commands
are passed to the external commands without modification. 
See also, the resource <em>saveInTMP</em>.

   <p>There are simple <em>usage</em> dialogs for each command and one for the
complete set of commands.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>l [filename]</code>
     <dd>Loads a new datafile (layout) and, if confirmed, overwrites any existing unsaved data. 
The filename and the searchpath (<em>filePath</em>) are passed to the
command defined by <em>fileCommand</em>. 
If no filename is specified a file select box will popup.

     <br><dt><code>le [filename]</code>
     <dd>Loads an element description into the paste buffer. 
The filename and the searchpath (<em>elementPath</em>) are passed to the
command defined by <em>elementCommand</em>. 
If no filename is specified a file select box will popup.

     <br><dt><code>m [filename]</code>
     <dd>Loads an layout file into the paste buffer. 
The filename and the searchpath (<em>filePath</em>) are passed to the
command defined by <em>fileCommand</em>. 
If no filename is specified a file select box will popup.

     <br><dt><code>q[!]</code>
     <dd>Quits the program without saving any data (after confirmation). 
q! doesn't ask for confirmation, it just quits.

     <br><dt><code>s [filename]</code>
     <dd>Data and the filename are passed to the command defined by the resource
<em>saveCommand</em>. It must read the layout data from <em>stdin</em>. 
If no filename is entered, either the last one is used
again or, if it is not available, a file select box will pop up.

     <br><dt><code>rn [filename]</code>
     <dd>Reads in a netlist file.  If no filename is given
a file select box will pop up. 
The file is read via the command defined by the
<em>RatCommand</em> resource. The command must send its output to <em>stdout</em>.

     <p>Netlists are used for generating rat's nests (see <a href="Rats-Nest.html#Rats%20Nest">Rats Nest</a>) and for
verifying the board layout (which is also accomplished by the <em>Ratsnest</em>
command).

     <br><dt><code>w[q] [filename]</code>
     <dd>These commands have been added for the convenience of <code>vi</code> users and
have the same functionality as <em>s</em> combined with <em>q</em>.

     <br><dt><code>actionCommand</code>
     <dd>Causes the actionCommand to be executed.  This allows you to initiate actions
for which no bindings exist in the resource file.  It can be used to initiate any
action with whatever arguments you enter.  This makes it possible to do things
that otherwise would be extremely tedious.  For example, to change the drilling
hole diameter of all vias in the layout to 32 mils, you could select everything using the
selection menu, then type "<em>:ChangeDrillSize(SelectedVias, 32)</em>".  (This will
only work provided the via's diameter is sufficiently large to accommodate a 32 mil hole). 
Another example might be to set the grid to 1 mil by typing "<em>:SetValue(Grid, 1)</em>". 
Note that some actions use the current cursor location, so be sure to place the cursor
where you want before entering the command.  This is one of my favorite new
features in 1.5 and can be a powerful tool. Study the <a href="Actions.html#Actions">Actions</a> section to
see what actions are available.
