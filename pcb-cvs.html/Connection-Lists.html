<h3 class="section">Connection Lists</h3>

<p>After completing parts of your layout you may want to check if all drawn
connections match the ones you have in mind. This is probably best done
in conjunction with a net-list file: see <a href="Rats-Nest.html#Rats%20Nest">Rats Nest</a>. 
The following examples give more rudimentary ways to examine
the connections.
<pre class="example">         1) create at least two elements and name them
         2) create some connections between their pins
         3) optionally add some vias and connections to them
     </pre>

   <p>Now select <em>lookup connection</em> from the <em>Connections</em> menu,
move the cursor to a pin or via and press any mouse button. <code>Pcb</code>
will look for all other pins and/or vias connected to the one you have
selected and display the objects in a different color. 
Now try some of the reset options available from the same menu.

   <p>There also is a way to scan all connections of one element. Select
<em>a single element</em> from the menu and press any button at the
element's location. All connections of this element will be saved
to the specified file. 
Either the layout name of the element or its canonical name is used to
identify pins depending on the one which is displayed on the screen
(may be changed by <em>Display</em> menu).

   <p>An automatic scan of all elements is initiated by choosing
<em>all elements</em>. It behaves in a similar fashion to scanning a single
element except the resource <em>resetAfterElement</em>
is used to determine if connections should be reset before a new element is
scanned. Doing so will produce very long lists because the power lines are
rescanned for every element. By default the resource is set to <em>false</em>
for this reason.

   <p>To scan for unconnected pins select <em>unused pins</em> from the same
menu.
