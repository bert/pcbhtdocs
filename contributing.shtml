      PCB is developed by volunteers.  As with any volunteer project,
      we always can use more help.  This page tries to give some
      guidelines on how to more effectively help out.
      </p>

      <p>
      See <a href="bugs.html">Reporting Bugs</a> for information on
      where to report bugs and how to make an effective bug report.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="general">General Coding Guidelines</a></h2>
      <ul>
      <li>
      Use the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/">GNU Coding
      Standards</a> for source code formatting.  You can use the
      <code>indent</code> program to help reformat your code.
      </li>

      <li>
      Your code should compile cleanly without any compiler warnings.
      In the past we have found and fixed many bugs by simply paying
      attention to the compiler warnings.  Warnings that don't
      indicate real bugs end up encouraging people to ignore all the
      warnings.
      </li>

      <li>
      Changes which require the use of an additional library or tool
      are discouraged.  If there is a really good reason, then adding
      a dependency is not out of the question.  However we don't want
      to add extra baggage unnecessarily.
      </li>

      <li>
      Changes which add new export options or new exporters should add
      appropriate entries to the test suite.
      </li>

      <li>
      When you submit your patch to the patch tracking system, please
      log in.  This allows you to receive a notification
      when additional content is added to the ticket or if its status changes.  It is
      also useful when seeking feedback to see if a particular bug has
      been fixed.  Just including your email and posting without
      logging in causes additional work for the developers.
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h2><a name="testsuite">Test suite</a></h2>
      <p>PCB includes a test suite.  Currently the test suite does not
      check the GUI but it does check the various exporters.  The
      test suite is in the <code>pcb/tests</code> directory.  The
      <a
      href="http://git.gpleda.org/?p=pcb.git;a=blob_plain;f=tests/README.txt;hb=HEAD">
      README.txt</a> file there has complete documentation on how to
      use the test suite and how to add to the test suite.
      </p>
      <p>
      If you add a
      new exporter or if you add command line options to an existing
      exporter you must add a test suite entry.  Similarly if you find
      a bug in one of the exporters, the preferred procedure is to add
      a test suite entry which demonstrates the bug, fix the bug, and
      then verify that the test suite shows proper functionality.
      </p>

      <p>When a new test is added it is important to try and make it
      as simple and modular as possible.  In other words, if there is a
      problem with a particular footprint not exporting correctly,
      then make a test suite entry with just that footprint or a
      simplified view of that footprint.  Don't just use a board with
      a thousand other components on it because it makes debugging
      much harder.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="actions">PCB Actions</a></h2>
      <p>PCB uses "actions" internally to do much of the work.  An
      "action" can be thought of as a simplified function.  All of
      PCB's actions are fully documented in the <a
      href="manual.html">PCB manual</a>.  If you add any new actions,
      then you <em>must</em> add the appropriate documentation.  The
      documentation for all actions is embedded in the source code
      using specially formatted comments.  Search for the string
      "%start-doc" in the existing source code for many examples.
      This documentation is later automatically extracted when the
      manual is built.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="manual">PCB Manual</a></h2>
      <p>
      If your changes add to or modify the behavior of PCB in a way
      which is not simply a bug fix, then update or add to the
      manual.  The PCB manual is in the <code>doc/</code> directory
      from the main source tree.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="fileformat">File Format Changes</a></h2>
      <p>
      Do not change any file formats unless absolutely required.  If
      you do make a change to the file format (the parser is in
      <a
      href="http://git.gpleda.org/?p=pcb.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/parse_y.y;hb=HEAD">src/parse_y.y</a>
      then you need to update the PCB_FILE_VERSION macro in
      <a
      href="http://git.gpleda.org/?p=pcb.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/file.h;hb=HEAD">src/file.h</a>.
      The <code>.pcb</code> file format may not be changed in a way
      that prevents PCB loading any older file formats
      </p>
      <p>
      If you must change the file format, then the structured comments
      in 
      <a
      href="http://git.gpleda.org/?p=pcb.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/parse_y.y;hb=HEAD">src/parse_y.y</a>
      <em>must</em> be updated to reflect the change.  This is how the
      manual section on file formats is generated.
