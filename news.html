    <H2><A NAME="20050609">Development snapshot 20050609 available</A></H2>
    <p>
      A new snapshot release, pcb-200609, is available.  As always, this is
      a snapshot of a work in progress.
      A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:
      </p>
    <UL>
    <LI><EM>The GUI is now based on gtk2 instead of Xaw</EM>. This represents
     a fairly major change.  You will now need gtk-2.6 or higher installed
     along with any of its dependencies to build pcb.  On linux
     distributions, it is probably the case that you already have this.
     For *BSD, Solaris, and others, you may want to use NetBSD's pkgsrc
     to help install gtk2 and its dependencies.
     </LI>

     <LI>
     Flags are stored symbolically in the .pcb file.  This is the start
     of moving to support >8 layers.  Please note that >8 layer support
     is not yet available in this snapshot.
     </LI>

     <LI>
     Fixes for gcc-4
     </LI>

     <LI>
     As part of the switch to gtk2, the user customizable menu feature has
     been temporarily broken.  Hopefully this will be fixed by the next
     snapshot.  In addition, the loading of background images has also been
     temporarily broken.
     </LI>
    </UL>

    <H2><A NAME="20050315">Development snapshot 20050315 available</A></H2>
    <p>
      A new snapshot release, pcb-20050315, is available.  As always, this is
      a snapshot of a work in progress.  There have been a small
      handful bug fixes and feature additions.
      Thanks to everyone who has provided
      feedback.  Please note, this snapshot uses the same Xaw (Athena
      Widgets) based user interface that pcb has had for quite some time.
      A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:
      </p>
    <UL>
      <LI>Several footprint library fixes including TO-220 parse errors and
        incorrect drill holes on several componenets. </LI>

      <LI>Fixed a crashing bug in the pinout window.</LI>

      <LI>Allow the FAB author to be set via an Xresource to override what
           PCB might have gotten from the gecos information.</LI>

      <LI>Added table of standard drill sizes to the manual.</LI>

      <LI>Fixed a crashing bug when trying to use arrow keys to adjust the scale
          slider in the print dialog box.</LI>
    </UL>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20050311">GTK version in CVS</A></H2>
    <p>
      March 11, 2005.  Bill Wilson's port of pcb to <a
    href="http://www.gtk.org">gtk</a>
      has been imported into CVS.  As part of this effort, a branch in
      cvs called "pcb-xaw" has been created which contains the Athena Widgets
      (Xaw) version of pcb.  If you are tracking pcb with CVS and you want the
      Xaw version, you will need to use the "-r pcb-xaw" option to cvs when
      updating next time.</p>
     <p>
      This represents a fairly substantial change to pcb and there are a few
      known issues which still need to be addressed.  However, the port is 
      complete enough to try out.  Once some of the key issues are taken care
      of and the port stabilizes a bit, a snapshot release using gtk will be
      released.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many thanks to Bill for all of his work in making this happen.
      </p>

      feature additions and as always there is still more to do.
      Thanks to everyone who has provided
      feedback.  A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:

    <H2><A NAME="20040215">Development snapshot 20040215 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    Febuary 15, 2004.  A new snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    is available.
    pcb-20040215 is the 3rd development snapshot release since moving to
    SourceForge.  This snapshot represents a big step forward in PCB.  
    Anyone following the CVS changes over the last month will have noticed
    a very large number of bug fixes and feature enhancements by harry eaton.
    A partial list of what's new is:
    <UL>
    <LI>Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1.0 mil</LI>
    <LI>Improved DRC checking</LI>
    <LI>Mirroring/rotating of buffers</LI>
    <LI>Undo works on trace optimizations</LI>
    <LI>Fixed polygon undo bugs</LI>
    <LI>Fix arc DRC bugs</LI>
    <LI>Added local measurement for line drawing</LI>
    <LI>Added mode for polygon viewing to help examing planes</LI>
    <LI>Added new footprint libraries (amp, amphenol, bourns, johnstech,
	minicircuits, panasonic)</LI>
    <LI>Added new footprints to the geda library</LI>
    <LI>Other bug fixes</LI>
    </UL>
    Please note that, as with previous snapshots, this snapshot represents
    a work in progress.  Download the snapshot
    from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73743">Files Release section</a>
    of the PCB SourceForge project page.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20040105">Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1 mil</A></H2>
    <p>
    January 5, 2004.  Harry Eaton has committed a series of changes which
    increase the resolution of PCB.  Prior versions of PCB used 1 mil as the
    fundamental unit.  As packaging and board fabrication technology has
    progressed, this resolution is no longer adequate.  The new internal unit is 0.01
    mil.  Old libraries may still be used and old designs may be opened, but
    the design will be saved in the new hi-resolution format.  This means
    you will not be able to re-open the layout in an older version of PCB.
    </p>
    <p>
    The source tree immediately prior to the hi-resolution changes is tagged
    with "low_res".  To update your CVS tree to the last version of the
    low resolution PCB, use <tt>cvs update -PdA -r low_res</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe that most if not all of the bugs related to this change have been
    worked out, but further independent testing is always useful.

    <p>
    November 13, 2003.  A snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    has been released and is available from the PCB <A
    HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pcb">Sourceforge 
    Project Summary Page</A>.  This is the second snapshot release
    since moving to sourceforge.  This snapshot includes cygwin and
    Darwin support as well as new QFN footprints, improved documentation
    on how the libraries work and interfacing with
    <A HREF="http://www.geda.seul.org">gEDA</A>, and several bug fixes.
    Many thanks to everyone who has supplied patches and bug reports.
    </p>
    <p>
    As with the previous snapshot, please note that this snapshot
    has not gone through a rigorous
    release engineering cycle but rather is a simple snapshot of a
    work in progress.

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20031111">PCB Ported to Cygwin</A></H2>
    <p>
    November 11, 2003.  PCB should now compile and run "out of the box"
    under cygwin.  You will need Xfree86 installed as well as the same
    set of development tools (gcc, m4, make, tcl/tk) as needed on other
    operating systems.

    <H2><A NAME="20030815">Development snapshot 20030815 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    August 15, 2003.  A snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    has been released and is available from the PCB <A
    HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pcb">Sourceforge 
    Project Summary Page</A>.  We plan on making periodic snapshots
    available to assist those who are unable to use the anonymous CVS
    service.  This will also allow developers of various packaging
    systems to create PCB snapshot packages.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please note that these snapshots have not gone through a rigorous
    release engineering cycle but rather are simple snapshots of a
    work in progress.

    been added to the web pages to give pointers to additional PCB
    related resources.
