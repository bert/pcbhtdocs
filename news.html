    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="4.0.1">PCB Release 4.0.1 available</A></H2>
    <p>
Dear Users,<br>
<br>
This release fixes a number of bugs.<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
<br>
The pcb development team<br>
<br>
<h3>User experience improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>reorchestrated the closing of the command window to not crash.
<li>only invalidate the screen after changes to the crosshair or mark
are complete.
</ul>

<h3>Plugins</h3>
<ul>
<li>none
</ul>

<h3>Exporters</h3>
<ul>
<li>fix for gcode dimensions.
<li>added a regression test for the IPC-D-356 exporter.
<li>added more documentation for the IPC-D-356 netlist exporter.
</ul>

<h3>Footprints library</h3>
<ul>
<li>add macro with more programmability for 2 pin axial components. Use
  this to add a few IPC-7251 compliant footprints for axial inductors,
  horizontally mounted.  Use this in turn for the TDK B82145A RF chokes
  family.
<li>add toko category and the 7P variable inductors.
<li>gen_geda_*.awk were nearly identical to gen_*.awk so add 2 lines to
  geda.inc so we can use the same script for everything.  Verified that
  pcblib-newlib builds with identical results before/after.
<li>for the horizontally mounted axial macro add the missing bits for
  marking polarity on parts like diodes.
<li>add PKG_RADIAL_MM100 macro for doing more general metric 2 pin radial
  packages.
<li>add some IPC radial capacitor footprints and use those to create some
  united chemicon footprints.
<li>add DO-41 diode package, horizontally mounted.
<li>add PKG_MTHOLE_GENERIC macro for fairly generic mounting holes.  Use
  this to define IPC mounting holes for #4 and #6 machine screws with
  pan heads or flat washers for both "tight" (board < 4") and "loose"
  (board > 4") fits.
<li>add TO-263 footprint.
<li>add some notes about m4 library development.
<li>fix problem in some possible invocations of the generic mounting hole
  macro.  All footprints pass syntax checks again.
<li>remove an extra empty attribute which is not needed and causes
  warnings in the mounting hole macro.
<li>fix clearance on the Toko 7P footprint.
<li>in the mounting hole macro, change the calculation of the pad size for
  the support vias to make them as large as possible without actually
  changing the copper (the support vias are covered by the main pad).
  This does not affect the fabricated board but it does remove some
  false positive DRC complaints.
</ul>

<h3>Developer experience improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>allow translators to change number of tabs in message.
<li>In the test suite, check for a working X display using xhost before
  running action script tests
<li>match() with 3 arguments is a gawk extension. Rework the code to avoid
  using a 3 argument call to match() in one spot.  Lets the script run
  with gawk or NetBSD's awk (20121220).  Verified that the generated
  result is identical to the previous gawk result using both gawk and
  NetBSDs awk.
<li>change from AC_FD_CC to AS_MESSAGE_LOG_FD
<li>removed the antifork abomination.
<li>disabled one of the checks used to deal with older gdlib installs on
  some linux systems when building under cygwin as the test has
  problems.  Repairs building for mingw under cygwin.
<li>when building under cygwin, create a pcbtest.bat batch file that
  allows testing the compiled pcb without installing.  This is somewhat
  analogous to the pcbtest.sh script generated on linux and other
  unix-like systems.
<li>cleanup the win32 build script a good bit.  An important change is
  that instead of blindly installing all of the mingw cross system root
  files, only install a set of listed ones.  This not only reduces the
  size of the windows installer but makes sure we have a more repeatable
  build and know what we are actually bundling into the installer.
<li>fixed the Attribute deletion code.
</ul>

    <!-- ********************* pcb-4.0.0 ********************** -->
    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="4.0.0">PCB Release 4.0.0 available</A></H2>
    <p>

Dear Users,<br>
<br>
It has been quite some time since the last snapshot of pcb was released
in March 2014.<br>
<br>
Since then quite a lot of bugs were fixed and new features added, below
this introduction a summary is given of the improvements and additions
since the latest snapshot "pcb-20140316".<br>
<br>
This release represents over 480 commits (mostly bugfixes and code
refactoring) and as such this summary clearly is not complete.<br>
<br>
This pcb release 4.0.0 has a significant change in the major version
number.<br>
<br>
This is done to make a fresh start and to get away from the 1.99z
version with YYYYMMDD snapshots.<br>
<br>
Kind regards,<br>
<br>
The pcb development team<br>
<br>
<h3>User experience improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li> added the command-line option --save-metric-only.
<li> added escaping of Attribute values.
<li> added a translation of the Getting Started with PCB for pt_BR.
<li> added translatable tooltips for toolbar buttons.
<li> added "Report net length" to Menu -> Info in Gtk.
<li> added a script for generating a key binding list.
<li> added tooltips in the GTK HID UI.
<li> the puller no longer crosses unplated holes.
<li> solder/component outer layer names changed to top/bottom.
<li> pcb now uses a tilde instead of a dash for backup filenames.
<li> corrections in the user documentation.
<li> the position "delta" display no longer forces the GTK HID window to
  grow.
<li> write time in ASCII locale into exported files.
<li> allow for up to 10000 dpi on png exporter output.
</ul>

<h3>Plugins</h3>
<ul>
<li> added smartdisperse for dispersing elements better, contributed by
  Ben Jackson.
<li> added relocate for relocating elements, contributed by Jean Richard.
<li> added RenumberBlock() and RenumberBuffer(), contributed by DJ Delorie.
<li> added teardrops(), contributed by DJ Delorie.
</ul>

<h3>Exporters</h3>
<ul>
<li> added a netlister conforming to the IPC-D-356 standard, contributed by
  Jerome Marchand.
<li> changed "as-shown" to "screen-layer-order" in the png and eps hids.
</ul>

<h3>Footprints library</h3>
<ul>
<li> added a SC88A footprint.
<li> added a LQFP80-10 footprint.
<li> added QFN24_5 and TQFN24_5 footprints.
<li> added a SOD523 footprint.
<li> the SOT325 package had a wrong numbering.
<li> renamed the SOT325 footprint to SOT353.
<li> in the ALF footprint the drill holes were too tight.
<li> an infinite loop in the SIL m4 macro was fixed.
</ul>

<h3>Developer experience improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li> made a start with adding Doxygen developer documentation tags in the
  source files.
  A pcb.dox configuration file is available in the "doc/doxygen"
  directory so developers can build the documentation there by invoking
  "doxygen pcb.dox" from the CLI.<br>
  This is not done by configuring with --enable-docs, which is solely
  reserved for the generation of User documentation.
<li> added numerous fixes in the win32 target.
</ul>

<h3>Notes for early adapters</h3>
<p>
In the git repository two tags have been added to allow for checking
out of pcb-4.0.0 at the branch point (git checkout pcb-4.0.0-base) or at
the release point (git checkout pcb-4.0.0-RELEASE).<br>
This is in line with tagging done in former snapshots.
</p>

<h3>Changed dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li> autoconf 2.60 --> 2.69.
<li> gettext 0.14 --> 0.19.3.
</ul>
</p>

  nubs on metric grids" issue.  Also, units are allowed on pretty much
  every "coordinate" that PCB accepts.  Example: 5.4in, 10cm, 0.55mm.
  New configure option --enable-coord64 to force (slower?) 64-bit type
  for coordinates on 32-bit systems (if you need a board bigger than 1
  meter across).  The internal precision is 1 nanometer, the internal
  type is "Coord".
<li> MinGW support.

<li> Gerber exporter has options for including outlines on other layers.
<li> Edited footprint files are saved as footprints, not pcbs.
<li> Improved gtk library search/filter.
<li> Default layer stack is now a six-layer template with outline.
<li> If the board has an outline layer, an outline will be shown if no
  other outline is specified.
<li> Group[] string allows t/b synonyms for c/s.  "top" and "bottom" are
  the standard names now.
<li> PCB will save files with an older version tag if newer features aren't needed.
<li> Autorouter has a progress dialog.
<li> PCB will no longer let you delete the last top/bottom layer.
<li> Refcard has been updated.
<li> Documentation updates.
<li> Layes with the PCB::skip-drc attribute set are ignored during DRC.
<li> Allow numeric keys to also choose the silk layer.
<li> Minor readability tweaks to the default font.
<li> Via copper may overlap.
<li> User is notified if an Import() cannot find all the footprints.
</ul>

<p><b><u>Bug Fixes</u></b></p>

<li> Lesstif menu is now internationalizable.
<li> Refdes labels in a font-less layout can be moved.
<li> Import can correctly update elements on the bottom side.
<li> DRC no longer treats unplated holes as conducting.
</ul>

<p><b><u>Other</u></b></p>

<ul>
<li> Updated and new translations, including Dutch.
<li> Many polygon speedups.
<li> Numerous build-related cleanups.
<li> Numerous minor speed-related cleanups.
<li> GTK 2.18 is the minimum required version.

    <p>
    Changes included in this release are:
    </p>

    <UL>

<li> Add polygon clipping code.  This is a big change to how polygons are handled.  
  The new code now removes islands and correctly identifies open circuits caused
  by a trace fully cutting through a polygon.  In addition, the RS-274-X output
  is now simpler and works with some board houses that use older non-conforming
  sofware.  Different styles for thermal reliefs are also now supported as part
  of the polygon clipper code.
</li>
<li> Add support for plugins
</li>
<li> Many improvements to the autorouter.
</li>
<li> Various improvements to the trace optimizer.
</li>
<li> Add a fontmode for editing pcb fonts
</li>
<li> Add progress() hook to HID structure
</li>
<li> Fix a bug with non-functional windows on some window managers commonly
  found on OS-X
</li>
<li> Add support for controlling pcb via dbus
</li>
<li> Fix various bugs which would cause a crash
</li>
<li> Add --scale for postscript scaling
</li>
<li> Intercept window manager delete events with the GTK gui
</li>
<li> Scan the .pcb file for a FileVersion value.  This is not written out yet
  but will be in future versions.  
</li>
<li> Warn if non-manhattan lines are trying to become pads.
</li>
<li> Allow no-solder paste pads to support fiducials
</li>
<li> Report in mm or mils as selected by user
</li>
<li> Allow reordering of layers
</li>
<li> add some more QFN packages
</li>
<li> fix building with sun studio c compiler
</li>
<li> Made a pcb installation be relocatable.
</li>
<li> Convert the m4 libraries to newlib libraries as part of building a distfile.
  The m4 libraries are still considered the sources and as such are still
  distributed but this eliminates the need for m4 at runtime for footprints.
</li>
<li> Got rid of the pcb wrapper script around pcb-bin.
</li>
<li> Remove some old footprints of questionable naming, accuracy, or usefulness.
</li>
<li> Get the autosave/backup code working on all GUI's
</li>
<li> Fix some drill size rounding in the reports
</li>
<li> Changed the backup file name to be derived from the .pcb file name
</li>
<li> Added a command line option for DrawGrid
</li>
<li> Fix logic for adding new ratlines
</li>

<li> Enhance the win32/build_pcb script used to generate a non-cygwin windows
  installer.
</li>
<li> Make pcb work under non-cygwin windows
</li>

    <p>
    Snapshot release pcb-20060414 has been released.  This is the
    first snapshot of the new HID version of PCB.
    HID, which stands for Human Interface Device is
    the abstraction created by DJ Delorie which
    separates the core PCB code from the graphical
    user interface.  In this release, two GUI HID's
    are supported, gtk and lesstif.  In addition,
    there are HID exporters for postscript and
    encapsulated postscript, RS-274-X (gerber), bill
    of materials, centroid file, and png/gif/jpeg.
    This represents a major restructuring of the
    code and many months of work.

    Additional changes are:
    </p>
    <UL>
    <LI>
      PCB's actions (the commands which drive the core of the program and
      may be directly accessed by the user) now have the documentation in-line
      in the code and the actions reference section of the manual is 
      extracted from the in-line documentation.  The goal it to provide more
      complete and accurate documentation.  As always the manual is still
      a work in progress but it is getting more complete and up to date.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Fixed a long standing segfault when saving connection data
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Fixed a DRC bug
    </LI>

    <LI>
      Fix some rounding issues when setting sizes.  Hopefully this will address
      the issue with 23.99 mil drills and related problems.
    </LI>

    <LI>
      The html manual is now in one file instead of many files
    </LI>

    <LI>
      The lesstif HID now supports loading of background images to help
      recover a layout which may exist in hardcopy form only.
    </LI>
    </UL>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20060321hid">HID Code Merge</A></H2>
    <p>
      After several months of hard work lead by DJ Delorie, the Human Interface Device
      (HID) version of PCB was merged into CVS on 2006-03-21.  As part of this work,
      DJ has added
      a lesstif GUI and Bill Wilson contributed a tremendous effort to get his GTK
      GUI working in the HID framework.  In addition a new png/gif/jpeg export option
      has been added.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of the HID project was to remove all of the GUI dependent code from the
      core of PCB.  In addition to opening the doors to a future win32 port (volunteers?),
      this should make the core code easier to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      This represents a fairly major overhaul of a lot of code so lots of testing would
      be appreciated.

      A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:
      </p>
    <UL>
    <LI><EM>The GUI is now based on gtk2 instead of Xaw</EM>. This represents
     a fairly major change.  You will now need gtk-2.6 or higher installed
     along with any of its dependencies to build pcb.  On linux
     distributions, it is probably the case that you already have this.
     For *BSD, Solaris, and others, you may want to use NetBSD's pkgsrc
     to help install gtk2 and its dependencies.
     </LI>

     <LI>
     Flags are stored symbolically in the .pcb file.  This is the start
     of moving to support &gt;8 layers.  Please note that &gt;8 layer support
     is not yet available in this snapshot.

     <LI>
     Fixes for gcc-4
     </LI>

     As part of the switch to gtk2, the user customizable menu feature has
     been temporarily broken.  Hopefully this will be fixed by the next
     snapshot.  In addition, the loading of background images has also been
     temporarily broken.

    <H2><A NAME="20050311">GTK version in CVS</A></H2>
    <p>
      March 11, 2005.  Bill Wilson's port of pcb to <a
    href="http://www.gtk.org">gtk</a>
      has been imported into CVS.  As part of this effort, a branch in
      cvs called "pcb-xaw" has been created which contains the Athena Widgets
      (Xaw) version of pcb.  If you are tracking pcb with CVS and you want the
      Xaw version, you will need to use the "-r pcb-xaw" option to cvs when
      updating next time.</p>
     <p>
      This represents a fairly substantial change to pcb and there are a few
      known issues which still need to be addressed.  However, the port is 
      complete enough to try out.  Once some of the key issues are taken care
      of and the port stabilizes a bit, a snapshot release using gtk will be
      released.
      </p>
      <p>
      Many thanks to Bill for all of his work in making this happen.

    Febuary 15, 2004.  A new snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    is available.
    pcb-20040215 is the 3rd development snapshot release since moving to
    SourceForge.  This snapshot represents a big step forward in PCB.  
    Anyone following the CVS changes over the last month will have noticed
    a very large number of bug fixes and feature enhancements by harry eaton.
    A partial list of what's new is:
    <UL>
    <LI>Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1.0 mil</LI>
    <LI>Improved DRC checking</LI>
    <LI>Mirroring/rotating of buffers</LI>

    <H2><A NAME="20040105">Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1 mil</A></H2>
    <p>
    January 5, 2004.  Harry Eaton has committed a series of changes which
    increase the resolution of PCB.  Prior versions of PCB used 1 mil as the
    fundamental unit.  As packaging and board fabrication technology has
    progressed, this resolution is no longer adequate.  The new internal unit is 0.01
    mil.  Old libraries may still be used and old designs may be opened, but
    the design will be saved in the new hi-resolution format.  This means
    you will not be able to re-open the layout in an older version of PCB.
    </p>
    <p>
    The source tree immediately prior to the hi-resolution changes is tagged
    with "low_res".  To update your CVS tree to the last version of the
    low resolution PCB, use <tt>cvs update -PdA -r low_res</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe that most if not all of the bugs related to this change have been
    worked out, but further independent testing is always useful.

    November 11, 2003.  PCB should now compile and run "out of the box"
