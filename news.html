    <p>
      A new snapshot, pcb-20040903, release is available.  As always, this is
      a snapshot of a work in progress.  Thanks to everyone who has provided
      feedback.  A summary of the changes since the last snapshot is:
      </p>
    <UL>
      <LI> enable -Wall when compiling with gcc.  Many compiler warnings have
        been fixed.
      </LI>

      <LI> add a short man page which refers the user to the real documentation
      </LI>

      <LI> Added ExecuteFile(file) action which allows the execution of several
        actions contained in a text file.

    <p>
       This has been an exciting 3 months for PCB.  Many improvements have
       been made in the program as well as additions and improvements to the
       footprint library.  Thanks to everyone who has provided feedback,
       patches, etc.
    </p>
    <H3>
       Additions/Improvements
    </H3>
    <UL>
      <LI> Expanded DRC checking
      <LI> "Realtime" DRC checking
      <LI> DRC settings are now stored in the board fle
      <LI> Centroid (X-Y) and bill of materials output
      <LI> Dynamic menus.  Users can now customize the menus via a
           site-wide, per-user, or per-project menu resource file.
      <LI> Significant improvements to autorouting of congested designs.
      <LI> Autorouter can now use power planes.
      <LI> Improved appearance in autorouter output.
      <LI> Silk on pads/pins is clipped in RS-274-X output

           may be effectively used on pcb files.
      <LI> The autoplace feature now actually works
      <LI> Added ToggleVisibility action
      <LI> Most of the database is now kept in rtrees which avoids linear
           searches.  This speeds up operation significantly.
      <LI> Added SetFlag, ClrFlag, ChangeFlag actions.

    <H2><A NAME="20040215">Development snapshot 20040215 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    Febuary 15, 2004.  A new snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    is available.
    pcb-20040215 is the 3rd development snapshot release since moving to
    SourceForge.  This snapshot represents a big step forward in PCB.  
    Anyone following the CVS changes over the last month will have noticed
    a very large number of bug fixes and feature enhancements by harry eaton.
    A partial list of what's new is:
    <UL>
    <LI>Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1.0 mil</LI>
    <LI>Improved DRC checking</LI>
    <LI>Mirroring/rotating of buffers</LI>
    <LI>Undo works on trace optimizations</LI>
    <LI>Fixed polygon undo bugs</LI>
    <LI>Fix arc DRC bugs</LI>
    <LI>Added local measurement for line drawing</LI>
    <LI>Added mode for polygon viewing to help examing planes</LI>
    <LI>Added new footprint libraries (amp, amphenol, bourns, johnstech,
	minicircuits, panasonic)</LI>
    <LI>Added new footprints to the geda library</LI>
    <LI>Other bug fixes</LI>
    </UL>
    Please note that, as with previous snapshots, this snapshot represents
    a work in progress.  Download the snapshot
    from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73743">Files Release section</a>
    of the PCB SourceForge project page.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20040105">Internal resolution changed to 0.01 mil from 1 mil</A></H2>
    <p>
    January 5, 2004.  Harry Eaton has committed a series of changes which
    increase the resolution of PCB.  Prior versions of PCB used 1 mil as the
    fundamental unit.  As packaging and board fabrication technology has
    progressed, this resolution is no longer adequate.  The new internal unit is 0.01
    mil.  Old libraries may still be used and old designs may be opened, but
    the design will be saved in the new hi-resolution format.  This means
    you will not be able to re-open the layout in an older version of PCB.
    </p>
    <p>
    The source tree immediately prior to the hi-resolution changes is tagged
    with "low_res".  To update your CVS tree to the last version of the
    low resolution PCB, use <tt>cvs update -PdA -r low_res</tt>.
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe that most if not all of the bugs related to this change have been
    worked out, but further independent testing is always useful.
    </p>

    <H2><A NAME="20031113">Development snapshot 20031113 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    November 13, 2003.  A snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    has been released and is available from the PCB <A
    HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pcb">Sourceforge 
    Project Summary Page</A>.  This is the second snapshot release
    since moving to sourceforge.  This snapshot includes cygwin and
    Darwin support as well as new QFN footprints, improved documentation
    on how the libraries work and interfacing with
    <A HREF="http://www.geda.seul.org">gEDA</A>, and several bug fixes.
    Many thanks to everyone who has supplied patches and bug reports.
    </p>
    <p>
    As with the previous snapshot, please note that this snapshot
    has not gone through a rigorous
    release engineering cycle but rather is a simple snapshot of a
    work in progress.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20031111">PCB Ported to Cygwin</A></H2>
    <p>
    November 11, 2003.  PCB should now compile and run "out of the box"
    under cygwin.  You will need Xfree86 installed as well as the same
    set of development tools (gcc, m4, make, tcl/tk) as needed on other
    operating systems.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20030815">Development snapshot 20030815 available</A></H2>
    <p>
    August 15, 2003.  A snapshot of the development sources for PCB
    has been released and is available from the PCB <A
    HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/pcb">Sourceforge 
    Project Summary Page</A>.  We plan on making periodic snapshots
    available to assist those who are unable to use the anonymous CVS
    service.  This will also allow developers of various packaging
    systems to create PCB snapshot packages.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please note that these snapshots have not gone through a rigorous
    release engineering cycle but rather are simple snapshots of a
    work in progress.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20030813">Web page links section added</A></H2>
    <p>
    August 13, 2003.  A new <A HREF="links.html">links</A> section has
    been added to the web pages to give pointers to additional PCB
    related resources.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20030622">Trace optimizer added</A></H2>
    <p>
    June 22, 2003.  DJ Delorie has incorporated his trace optimizer.
