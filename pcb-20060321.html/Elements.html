<h4 class="subsection">3.5.6 Elements</h4>

<p>Some of the functions related to elements only work if both the package
layer and the pin layer are switched on.

   <p>Now that you're familiar with many of the basic commands, it is
time to put the first element on the layout. 
First of all, you have to load data into the paste buffer. 
There are four ways to do this:
<pre class="example">        1) load the data from a library
        2) load the data from a file
        3) copy data from an already existing element
        4) convert objects in the buffer into an element
</pre>
   <p>We don't have any elements on the screen yet nor anything in the
buffer, so we use number one.

   <p><a name="index-example-files-97"></a><a name="index-m4_002c-preprocessing-example-files-98"></a>Select <em>lsi</em> from the menu in the library window press
<em>&lt;Btn1&gt;</em> twice at the appropriate text-line to get
the MC68030 CPU. 
The data is loaded and the mode is switched to <em>pastebuffer-mode</em>. 
Each notify event now creates one of these beasts. Leave the mode
by selecting a different one or by <em>&lt;Key&gt;Escape</em> which resets
all modes.. 
The cross hair is located at the <em>mark</em> position as defined by
the data file. Rotating the buffer contents is done by selecting
the <em>rotate</em> entry of the <em>Buffer</em> menu or by pressing
<em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;F3</em>. The contents of the buffer
are valid until new data is loaded into it either by a cut-to-buffer
operation, copy-to-buffer operation or by loading a new data file. 
There are 5 buffers
available  (possibly more or less if changed at compile time
with the <code>MAX_BUFFER</code> variable in <span class="file">globalconfig.h</span>). 
Switching between them is done by selecting a menu entry or
by <em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;1..MAX_BUFFER</em>. 
Each of the two board sides has its own buffers.

   <p>The release includes all data files for the circuits that are used
by the demo layout. The elements in the LED example are not found in the library,
but you can lift them from the example itself if you want. 
If you have problems with the color of the cross hair, change the resource
<em>cross hairColor</em> setting to a different one.

   <p><a name="index-example-of-loading-an-element-file-99"></a><a name="index-pins_002c-an-example-100"></a><a name="index-example-of-pin-handling-101"></a>Now load a second circuit, the MC68882 FPU for example. 
Create the circuit as explained above. You now have two different unnamed
elements. Unnamed means that the layout-name of the element
hasn't been set yet. Selecting <em>description</em> from the <em>Display</em>
menu displays the description string of the two circuits which
are CPU and FPU. The values of the circuits are set to MC68030 and MC68882. 
Each of the names of an element may be changed
by <em>&lt;Key&gt;n</em> at the elements location and editing the old name in
the bottom input line. Naming pins and vias is similar to elements. 
You can hide the element name so that it won't appear on the board
silkscreen by pressing <em>&lt;key&gt;h</em> with the cursor over the element. 
Doing so again un-hides the element name.

   <p>Entering <kbd>:le</kbd> and selecting an element data file is
the second way to load circuits.

   <p>The third way to create a new element is to copy an existing one. 
Please refer to <a href="Moving-and-Copying.html#Moving-and-Copying">Moving and Copying</a>.

   <p><a name="index-example-of-creating-an-element-102"></a><a name="index-element_002c-creating-a-new-package-103"></a><a name="index-pastebuffer_002c-convert-contents-to-element-104"></a><a name="index-buffer_002c-convert-contents-to-element-105"></a>The fourth way to create a new element is to convert a buffer's contents
into an element.  Here's how it's done: Select the Via-tool from the
<em>Tool pallet</em>.  Set the grid spacing to something appropriate for
the element pin spacing.  Now create a series of vias where the pins
go.  Create them in pin number order. It is often handy to place a reference
point (<em>!Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;m</em>) in the center of the first pin in order to measure
the location of the other pins.  Next make a solder-side layer the active
layer from the <em>active-layer</em> popup menu.  Now draw the outline of
the element using lines and arcs.  When you're done, select everything that
makes up the element with a box selection (<em>&lt;Btn3Down&gt; drag,
&lt;Btn3Up&gt;</em>). Now select "cut selection to buffer" from the <em>Buffer</em>
menu. Position the cursor over the center of pin 1 and press the left
button to load the data into the buffer. 
Finally select "convert buffer to element" from the <em>Buffer</em> menu. 
You'll only want to create elements this way if they aren't already in the
library.  It's also probably a good idea to do this before starting any of
the other aspects of a layout, but it isn't necessary.

   <p>To display the pinout of a circuit move to it and press <em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;d</em>
or select <em>show pinout</em> from the <em>Objects</em> menu. A new window
pops up and displays the complete pinout of the element. This display can
be difficult to read if the component has been rotated 90 degrees :-(
therefore, the new window will show an un-rotated view so the pin names
are readable. 
<em>&lt;Key&gt;d</em> displays the name of one or all pins/pads inside the
Layout area, this is only for display on-screen, it has no effect on any
printing of the layout.

   <p>You also may want to change a pin's or pad's current size by pressing
<em>&lt;Key&gt;s</em> to increase or <em>Shift&lt;Key&gt;s</em> to decrease it. While
this is possible, it is not recommended since care was probably taken
to define the element structure in the first place. You can also change the thickness
of the element's silkscreen outline with the same keys. You can
change whether a pin or SMD pad is rounded or square with the <em>&lt;Key&gt;q</em>. 
SMD pads should usually have squared ends. Finally, you can change whether
the non-square pins are round or octagonal with the <em>!Ctrl&lt;Key&gt;o</em>.

   <p>SMD elements and silkscreen objects are drawn in the "invisible object"
color if they are located on the opposite side of the board.
