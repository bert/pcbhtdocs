<h3 class="section">9.1 gEDA</h3>

<p>This section shows how to use gEDA as the schematic capture front-end for
a PCB design.  This section is not intended to be complete documentation
on gEDA and it is assumed that the user has at least some familiarity
with the gEDA suite of programs.

   <p>The basic steps in a gEDA + PCB design flow are:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Set up project directories
<li>Set up gEDA (gschem/gnetlist) config files
<li>Set up gsch2pcb config files
<li>Capture schematics using <code>gschem</code> (part of gEDA)
<li>Create any unique PCB footprints needed for the design
<li>Generate initial PCB design using <code>gsch2pcb</code> (part of gEDA)
<li>Layout circuit board using <code>pcb</code>
<li>Make any additional schematic changes with <code>gschem</code> and
forward annotate to PCB with <code>gsch2pcb</code>
<li>Generate photoplot files (RS-274-X, also known as "Gerber") for
board vendor
        </ol>

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.1 Set Up Project Directories</h4>

<p>Although not required, a typical project directory will contain the
schematics and board layout at the top level. 
Schematic symbols and circuit board footprints which are unique to this
project are stored in subdirectories.  For this example, <span class="file">sym</span>
contains the project specific schematic symbols and <span class="file">pkg</span> contains
the project specific footprints.  Set up the project subdirectory and
subdirectories by executing:
<pre class="example">     mkdir ~/myproj
     cd ~/myproj
     mkdir sym
     mkdir pkg
     mkdir pkg/newlib
     mkdir pkg/m4
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">9.1.2 Set Up gEDA Config Files</h4>

<p>The gEDA tools, specifically <code>gschem</code> and <code>gnetlist</code>, use
configuration files to set the search path for symbol libraries in
addition to other user preferences.  Create a file in the top level
project directory called <span class="file">gschemrc</span>.  Add the following lines to
that file:
<pre class="example">     
     ;; list libraries here.  Order matters as it sets the
     ;; search order
     (component-library "./sym")
     
</pre>
   <p>This sets the local search path for the schematic capture program
<code>gschem</code>.  Now the netlister, <code>gnetlist</code>, must also be
configured.  This can be done by copying the file <span class="file">gschemrc</span> to
<span class="file">gnetlistrc</span> by running <span class="samp">cp gschemrc gnetlistrc</span>. 
Alternatively, you can create a soft link so only a single file needs to
be updated if additional symbol paths are added.  The link is created by
running <span class="samp">ln -s gschemrc gnetlistrc</span>.

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.3 Set Up <code>gsch2pcb</code> Config Files</h4>

<p>The program <code>gsch2pcb</code>, not to be confused with the older
<code>gschem2pcb</code> script, is used to link the schematic to layout. 
<code>gsch2pcb</code> is responsible for creating the netlist used to provide
connectivity information to PCB as well creating an initial layout with
all components instantiated in the design.  Forward annotation of
schematic changes to the layout is also done using <code>gsch2pcb</code>. 
<code>gsch2pcb</code> uses a project file to set up the schematic file names,
PCB library locations, and output file names.  Create a project file
called <span class="file">project</span> using the following as an example:
<pre class="example">     
     # List all the schematics to be netlisted
     # and laid out on the pc board.
     schematics      first.sch second.sch third.sch
     
     # For an output-name of foo, gsch2pcb generates files
     # foo.net, foo.pcb, and foo.new.pcb.  If there is no
     # output-name specified, the file names are derived from
     # the first listed schematic, i.e. first.net, etc.
     output-name  preamp
     
</pre>
   <h4 class="subsection">9.1.4 Capture Schematics Using <code>gschem</code></h4>

<p>This section is fairly brief and assumes familiarity with using the
<code>gschem</code> schematic capture program.  As you are creating your
schematics, be sure to observe the following rules:
     <ul>
<li>Make sure that each component in the schematic has a
<code>footprint</code> attribute that corresponds to a footprint in the PCB
library or a footprint you plan on creating. 
<li>Make sure all reference designators are unique.  One way to ensure
this is to run the <code>refdes_renum</code> script (part of gEDA) after the
schematics are created. 
</ul>

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.5 Create Any Unique PCB Footprints</h4>

<p>Create the new footprints you design needs using either the m4 style or
newlib style of PCB libraries.  Refer to <a href="Library-Creation.html#Library-Creation">Library Creation</a> for details on this
process.  For m4 style footprints, store them in the <span class="file">pkg/m4</span>
subdirectory and for newlib footprints, store them in the
<span class="file">pkg/newlib</span> subdirectory.

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.6 Generate Initial PCB Design Using <code>gsch2pcb</code></h4>

<p>The <code>gsch2pcb</code> program connects the schematic and layout.  It basic
operation is to call <code>gnetlist</code> to generate the connectivity
netlist that PCB used to verify connectivity and to instantiate all
elements found in the schematic to a new layout. 
The default, as of <code>gsch2pcb</code> version 0.9,  is to use any found  m4
style parts first and then search for newlib style if no old style part
was found.  By using the <code>--use-files</code> or <code>-f</code> flag to <code>gsch2pcb</code>
priority is given to newlib style parts even if m4 style are found.  You
may wish to verify this in the <code>gsch2pcb</code> documentation in case
this changes in the future. 
To start your layout,
run <span class="samp">gsch2pcb project</span> where <span class="file">project</span> is the project file
created previously.  This will create a new netlist file,
<span class="file">preamp.net</span>, and a new layout file, <span class="file">preamp.pcb</span>.

<h4 class="subsection">9.1.7 Layout Circuit Board</h4>

<p>Run PCB on the new layout by running <span class="samp">pcb preamp.pcb</span>. 
Load the netlist file by selecting "load netlist file" from the "file"
menu.  In the file selection dialog box, choose <span class="file">preamp.net</span>.  This
loads connectivity information into PCB.

   <p>Using the selection tool, grab and move apart the various footprints
with the middle mouse button.  Once the parts are moved apart from each
other, choose "optimize rats-nest" from the "Connects" menu.  This menu
choice will display and optimize the rats nest.  Use the rats nest to
help guide placement of the parts.  You may wish to re-run the "optimize
rats-nest" command after moving parts around.

   <p>After the placement is complete, use the line tool to add traces to the
board.  As traces are added, the corresponding rats line will disappear.

<h3 class="section">9.2 Forward Annotation of Schematic Changes</h3>

<p>If schematic changes are made after the layout has started,
<code>gsch2pcb</code> can be used to forward annotate these changes to the
layout.  To forward annotate schematic changes, run <span class="samp">gsch2pcb
project</span>.  This command will create the files <span class="file">preamp.new.pcb</span>,
<span class="file">preamp.net</span>, and modify the file <span class="file">preamp.pcb</span>.  The
modifications to <span class="file">preamp.pcb</span> include forward annotation of
schematic component value changes, adds any new components, and removes
any deleted components.

<h4 class="subsection">9.2.1 Generate Photoplot Files (RS-274-X)</h4>

<p>After the layout is complete, choose "edit layer-groupings" from the
"Settings" menu.  The LayerGroups form lets you specify which layers
will appear in each output layer group.  For example, in the default
form, layer group 1 has "front" and "front side" in it.  The
output file <span class="file">1.gbr</span> if DOS file names are used, or
<span class="file">somename_front.gbr</span> if long file names are used will contain the
"front" and "front side" layers in it.  Usually the defaults are
sufficient, but this form is still a useful reference.

   <p>Choose "print layout..." from the "File" menu.  In the print dialog box,
select "Gerber/RS-274X" for the device
driver.  Select the "outline", "alignment", and "drillhelper" options. 
To get DOS compatible file names, select the "DOS (8.3) names" option,
otherwise enter "preamp" for the filename.  Press "OK".

   <p>The following output files should have been created in the project directory. 
The names in parentheses correspond to the DOS compatible output file names.
