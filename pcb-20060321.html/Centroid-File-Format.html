<h3 class="section">E.1 Overview</h3>

<h3 class="section">E.2 File Format</h3>

<p>The centroid output file is in a standard comma seperated values (CSV)
format.  Comment lines begin with a &ldquo;#&rdquo;.  The output file contains a
header with an RCS Id tag (useful for those who will check the file
into a version control system), a version number for the file format,
some comments containing the author and title of the board, and a
comment describing the remainder of the file format.

   <p>An example centroid file is shown below.

   <h3 class="section">E.3 Computation of Centroid and Rotation</h3>

<p><a name="index-centroid-file_002c-algorithms-826"></a><a name="index-x_002dy-file_002c-algorithms-827"></a>The center of each element is found by averaging the (X,Y) coordinates
for the center of each pin and pad in the element.  For example if an
element has 2 pins, 1 at (1,0) and another at (1,4) then the centroid
will be at (1,2).

   <p>The calculation of rotation is a bit more complex.  Currently a
rotation is not stored for each element but rather the rotated element
is stored.  In other words if the element from the library has a pin
at (0,0) and (0,2) and it has been rotated by 90 degrees, then the
<span class="file">.pcb</span> file will store (0,0) and (2,0) for the pin locations with
no indication that they have been rotated from the original.

   <p>In the event that the element has only 1 pin, then the rotation is set
to zero.  If the element has only one pad (as opposed to a
through-hole pin), then the rotation of the pad is used.

   <p>When the element has multiple pins, the location of pin #1 is placed
in the coordinate system which has the centroid of the part at (0,0). 
Then which quadrant pin #1 falls in determines the rotation.  Zero
degrees of rotation is defined as pin #1 being in the upper left
quadrant.  Increasing angles correspond to counterclockwise rotation so a
rotation of 90 degrees places pin #1 in the lower left quadrant. 
Currently, the only allowed rotations are 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees.

   <p>If pin #1 happens to be at the centroid of the part, then pin #2 is
examined to see which quadrant it is located in.  The same rules apply
for the definitions of rotation.  In other words, when pin #1 is at
the centroid of the part and pin #2 is in the upper left quadrant, the
rotation is declared to be zero degrees.
