      Please note that while the PCB developers do care about fixing bugs,
      we all work on PCB in our free time and patience is appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>
      Bugs should be reported in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=73743&atid=538811">
      PCB bug tracker</a>.  While it is fine to ask questions
      on the <a href="http://www.geda.seul.org/mailinglist/index.html>gEDA mailing lists</a>,
      the bug tracker is the prefered location for bug reports.  This is because when
      a developer has some time to work on bugs they are collected in one location.
      </p>


      <p>
      When reporting bugs in PCB, please follow these guidelines.
      <UL>
      <LI>
      Please see if this bug has already been reported.
      </LI>

      <LI>
      Include the exact pcb version.  If it is a snapshot release, include the
      release number, if you built from CVS sources, include the date
      when you last updated your sources.
      </LI>

      <LI>
      Describe how the problem can easily be reproduced.  If you are able to provide
      a <em>small</em> test case that will be a tremendous help.  Bugs which require
      hours of effort to reproduce are likely to take a low priority.
      </LI>

      <LI>
      If you are able to provide a patch, that is always helpful.
      </LI>

      <LI>
      Please log into the bug tracking system.  This allows you to receive a notification
      when additional content is added to the bug report or if its status changes.  It is
      also useful when seeking feedback to see if a particular bug has been fixed.
      </LI>
