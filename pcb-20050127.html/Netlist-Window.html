<h3 class="section">Netlist Window</h3>

<p>The netlist window is very similar to the library window. On the left
is a list of all of the nets, on the right is the list of connections
belonging to the chosen net. The chosen net is highlighted in the
list and also shown on the second line of the window in red. If the
net name has a star to the left of it then it is "disabled". A disabled
net is treated as if it were not in the net list. This is useful, for
example, if you plan to use a ground plane and don't want the ground
net showing up in the rat's nest. You can enable/disable individual
nets by double-clicking the net name. If you want to enable or disable
all nets at once, there are two buttons at the top of the netlist
window for this purpose.

   <p>The button labeled <code>Sel Net On Layout</code>
can be used to select (on the layout) everything that is connected
(or is supposed to be connected) to the net. If you click on a
connection in the connection list, it will select/deselect
the corresponding pin or pad in the layout and also center the layout
window where it is located. If you "Find" (<code>lookup connection
to object</code> in the <b>Connects</b> menu [also <em>F</em> key]), a pin
or pad it will also choose the net and connection in the netlist window
if it exists in the netlist.

   <p>If no netlist exists for the layout, then the netlist window does not
appear. You can load a netlist from a file from the <b>File</b> menu. The
format for netlist files is described in <a href="Netlist-File.html#Netlist%20File">Netlist File</a>.
