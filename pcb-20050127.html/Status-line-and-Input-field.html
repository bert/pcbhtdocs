<h3 class="subsection">The Status-line and Input-field</h4>

<p>The status-line is located at the bottom edge of the main window. 
During normal operation the status information is visible there. 
When a selected menu operation requires an additional button click, the
status-line is replaced by a message telling you to position the cursor
and click. 
When a text input is required, the status-line is replaced by the
Input-field which has a prompt for typing the input.

   <p>The status-line shows, from left to right, the side of the board that you
are viewing (<em>Tab</em> key changes this), the current grid values,
if new lines are restricted to 45 degrees,
which type of 45 degree line mode is active, whether rubberband move and
rotate mode is on (R), and the zoom factor. 
This information is followed by the active line-width, via-size
and drilling hole, keepaway spacing, and text scaling. Last is the active buffer number and the
name of the layout. An asterisk appearing at the far left indicates that the
layout has been modified since the last save. 
Note that the name of the layout is not the same
thing as the filename of the layout. 
Change the grid factor to 1.0 mm from the <b>Screen</b> menu. Observe how the
status line shows the new grid setting. Except for the case of the metric
grid, all dimensions in the status line are in units of 0.001 inch (1 mil).

   <p>The input-field pops up (temporarily replacing the status-line) whenever user input
is required. Two keys are bound to the input field: the <em>Escape</em> key
aborts the input, <em>Return</em> accepts it. Let's change the name of a component
on the board to see how the input-field works. Position the cross hair over
R5, and press the <em>N</em> key. The input field pops-up showing the name
for you to edit. Go ahead and change the name, then hit return. Notice the name
of the element changed. Now undo the change by pressing the <em>U</em> key. You can
position the cross hair over the name, or the element before pressing the
<em>N</em> key.

   <p>Now select <code>realign grid</code> from the <b>Screen</b> menu. Notice that the
status line has been replaced with an instruction to position the cursor
where you want a grid point to fall. In this case, since the cross hair
can only fall on a grid point, you must move the tip of the finger cursor
to the place where you want a grid point to appear. Do not worry that
the cross hair is not coincident with the cursor. Click <em>Btn1</em> at
your chosen location. See how the grid has shifted, and the status line
has returned.

   <p>The present cross hair position is displayed in the upper right corner of the window. 
Normally this position is an absolute coordinate, but you can anchor a marker at
the cross hair location by pressing <em>Ctrl-M</em> (try it now) and then the
display will read both the absolute cross hair position as well as the difference
between it and the marker. The numbers enclosed in &lt; &gt; are the X and Y distances
between the cross hair and the mark, while the numbers enclosed in parenthesis
are the distance and angle from the mark to the cross hair. The values displayed
are always in units of 0.001 inch (1 mil). 
Pressing <em>Ctrl-M</em> again turns the marker off.
