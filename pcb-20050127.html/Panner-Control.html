<h3 class="subsection">The Panner Control</h4>

<p>The panner control, located at the upper left side of the window, is used to
adjust what portion of the layout is seen in the Layout area. The outer
rectangle of the panner represents the whole layout (extended to have the
panner aspect ratio), while the inner control rectangle represents the
portion seen through the Layout area. Slowly drag this part around with
the mouse (<em>Btn1</em>) to see how it pans the layout. Release the panner
control, but leave the pointer within the outer most rectangle of the
control. Now hit a few keyboard arrow keys. Each arrow key moves the region
seen one-half window size in the arrow direction. If you want to see a
portion of the layout that is off the top of the screen, you need to
drag the panner up, or hit the up arrow key.

   <p>Move the pointer back into the Layout area. 
Increase the zoom by hitting the <em>Z</em> key. See how the inner part of
the panner becomes smaller to reflect that you are viewing a smaller
part of the layout. Now zoom out by hitting <em>Shift-Z</em>. If you
hit the arrow key with the pointer in the Layout area, it moves
the pointer rather than scrolling the window. In general the keyboard
shortcuts depend on which region of <code>Pcb's</code> window the pointer
is over. For the most part, the key strokes in this manual refer to
the case when the pointer is in the Layout area. You can do fine
scrolling in the Layout area by dragging it directly with the
Panner tool. Press the <em>Escape</em> key to select the panner tool. 
Now drag in the layout area with <em>Btn1</em> down. You can scroll the drawing
window while the pointer is inside it with <em>Mod-Arrow</em>
keys.

   <p>If you are moving or drawing an object and go beyond the drawing
window borders, the window will auto-scroll. If you want to stop
the auto-scrolling while the pointer is outside the Layout area,
simply pass the pointer briefly over the panner control area, or
a menu button.

   <p>Another way to navigate around a layout is with <em>Shift-Btn3</em>. 
When pressed down, the layout will zoom so the whole extent of
objects is visible, and will return to the previous zoom when
you release the button, but will be centered at the cross hair
position where the button is released. You can do this while in
the middle of drawing an object. Try it now to center near
U7.
